        "0":"I will sing of Heracles, the son of Zeus and much the mightiest of men on earth.\n Alcmena bare him in Thebes , the city of lovely\n dances, when the dark-clouded Son of Cronos had lain with her. Once he used to wander over\n unmeasured tracts of land and sea ",
        "1":"at the bidding of King Eurystheus, and himself did many deeds of violence and endured\n many; but now he lives happily in the glorious home of snowy Olympus , and has neat-ankled Hebe for his wife. Hail, lord, son of Zeus' Give\n me success and prosperity. "
