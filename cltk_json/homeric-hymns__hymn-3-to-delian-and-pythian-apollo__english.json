        "0":"I will remember and not be unmindful of Apollo who shoots afar. As he goes through\n the house of Zeus, the gods tremble before him and all spring up from their seats when he\n draws near, as he bends his bright bow. ",
        "1":"But Leto alone stays by the side of Zeus who delights in thunder; and then she\n unstrings his bow, and closes his quiver, and takes his archery from his strong shoulders\n in her hands and hangs them on a golden peg against a pillar of his father's house. Then\n she leads him to a seat and makes him sit: ",
        "2":"and the Father gives him nectar in a golden cup welcoming his dear son, while the\n other gods make him sit down there, and queenly Leto rejoices because she bare a mighty\n son and an archer. Rejoice, blessed Leto, for you bare glorious children, ",
        "3":"the lord Apollo and Artemis who delights in arrows; her in Ortygia, and him in\n rocky Delos , as you rested against the great\n mass of the Cynthian hill hard by a palm-tree by the streams of Inopus. How, then, shall I\n sing of you who in all ways are a worthy theme of song? ",
        "4":"For everywhere, O Phoebus, the whole range of song is fallen to you, both over the\n mainland that rears heifers and over the isles. All mountain-peaks and high headlands of\n lofty hills and rivers flowing out to the deep and beaches sloping seawards and havens of\n the sea are your delight. ",
        "5":"Shall I sing how at the first Leto bare you to be the joy of men, as she rested\n against Mount Cynthus in that rocky isle, in sea-girt Delos —while on either hand a dark wave rolled on landwards driven by\n shrill winds —whence arising you rule over all mortal men? ",
        "6":"Among those who are in Crete , and in the\n township of Athens , and in the isle of\n Aegina and Euboea , famous for ships, in Aegae and Eiresiae and Peparethus near the sea, in Thracian Athos and\n Pelion 's towering heights and Thracian Samos\n and the shady hills of Ida, ",
        "7":"in Scyros and Phocaea and the high hill\n of Autocane and fair-lying Imbros and smouldering Lemnos and rich Lesbos , home of\n Macar , the son of Aeolus, and Chios , brightest of all the isles that lie in the sea, and\n craggy Mimas and the heights of Corycus ",
        "8":"and gleaming Claros and the sheer hill of Aesagea and watered Samos and the steep heights of Mycale, in Miletus and Cos, the city of Meropian men, and steep\n Cnidos and windy Carpathos , in Naxos and Paros and rocky Rhenaea — ",
        "9":"so far roamed Leto in travail with the god who shoots afar, to see if any land\n would be willing to make a dwelling for her son. But they\n greatly trembled and feared, and none, not even the richest of them, dared receive\n Phoebus, ",
        "10":"until queenly Leto set foot on Delos \n and uttered winged words and asked her: “ Delos ,\n if you would be willing to be the abode of my son Phoebus Apollo and make him a rich\n temple —; for no other will touch you, as you will find: and I think you will never be\n rich in oxen and sheep, ",
        "11":"nor bear vintage nor yet produce plants abundantly. But if you have the temple of\n far-shooting Apollo, all men will bring you hecatombs and gather here, and incessant\n savour of rich sacrifice will always arise, and you will feed those who dwell in you ",
        "12":"from the hand of strangers; for truly your own soil is not rich.” So spake Leto.\n And Delos rejoiced and answered and said:\n “Leto, most glorious daughter of great Coeus, joyfully would I receive your child the\n far-shooting lord; for it is all too true that I am ill-spoken of ",
        "13":"among men, whereas thus I should become very greatly honored. But this saying I\n fear, and I will not hide it from you, Leto. They say that Apollo will be one that is very\n haughty and will greatly lord it among gods and men all over the fruitful earth. ",
        "14":"Therefore, I greatly fear in heart and spirit that as soon as he sees the light of\n the sun, he will scorn this island —for truly I have but a hard, rocky soil —and overturn\n me and thrust me down with his feet in the depths of the sea; then will the great ocean\n wash deep above my head for ever, ",
        "15":"and he will go to another land such as will please him, there to make his temple\n and wooded groves. So many-footed creatures of the sea will make their lairs in me and\n black seals their dwellings undisturbed, because I lack people. Yet if you will but dare\n to swear a great oath, goddess, ",
        "16":"that here first he will build a glorious temple to be an oracle for men, then let\n him afterwards ",
        "17":"make temples and wooded groves amongst all men; for surely he will be greatly\n renowned. So said Delos . And Leto swear the\n great oath of the gods: “Now hear this, Earth and wide Heaven above, ",
        "18":"and dropping water of Styx (this is the strongest and most awful oath for the\n blessed gods), surely Phoebus shall have here his fragrant altar and precinct, and you he\n shall honor above all.” Now when Leto had sworn and ended\n her oath, ",
        "19":"\n Delos was very glad at the birth of the\n far-shooting lord. But Leto was racked nine days and nine nights with pangs beyond wont. ",
        "20":"And there were with her all the chiefest of the goddesses, Dione and Rhea and\n Ichnaea and Themis and loud-moaning Amphitrite and the other deathless goddesses save\n white-armed Hera, who sat in the halls of cloud-gathering Zeus. Only Eilithyia, goddess of\n sore travail, had not heard of Leto's trouble, for she sat on the top of Olympus beneath golden clouds by white-armed Hera's ",
        "21":"contriving, who kept her close through envy, because Leto with the lovely tresses\n was soon to bear a son faultless and strong. But the goddesses sent out Iris from the\n well-set isle to bring Eilithyia, promising her a great necklace strung with golden\n threads, nine cubits long. ",
        "22":"And they bade Iris call her aside from white-armed Hera, lest she might\n afterwards turn her from coming with her words. When swift Iris, fleet of foot as the\n wind, had heard all this, she set to run; and quickly finishing all the distance she came\n to the home of the gods, sheer Olympus , ",
        "23":"and forthwith called Eilithyia out from the hall to the door and spoke winged\n words to her, telling her all as the goddesses who dwell on Olympus had bidden her. So she moved the heart of Eilithyia in her dear\n breast; and they went their way, like shy wild-doves in their going. ",
        "24":"And as soon as Eilithyia the goddess of sore travail set foot on Delos , the pains of birth seized Leto, and she longed to\n bring forth; so she cast her arms about a palm tree and kneeled on the soft meadow while\n the earth laughed for joy beneath. Then the child leaped forth to the light, and all the\n goddesses raised a cry. ",
        "25":"Straightway, great Phoebus, the goddesses washed you purely and cleanly with\n sweet water, and swathed you in a white garment of fine texture, new-woven, and fastened a\n golden band about you. Now Leto did not give Apollo, bearer of the golden blade, her\n breast; but Themis duly poured nectar and ambrosia ",
        "26":"with her divine hands: and Leto was glad because she had borne a strong son and\n an archer. But as soon as you had tasted that divine heavenly food, O Phoebus, you could\n no longer then be held by golden cords nor confined with bands, but all their ends were\n undone. ",
        "27":"Forth-with Phoebus Apollo spoke out among the deathless goddesses: “The lyre and the curved bow shall ever be dear to me, and I will\n declare to men the unfailing will of Zeus.” So said Phoebus, the long-haired god who\n shoots afar and began to walk upon the wide-pathed earth; ",
        "28":"and all the goddesses were amazed at him. Then with gold all Delos [ was laden, beholding the child of Zeus and Leto,\n for joy because the god chose her above the islands and shore to make his dwelling in her:\n and she loved him yet more in her heart. ] blossomed as does a mountain-top with woodland\n flowers. ",
        "29":"And you, O lord Apollo, god of the silver bow, shooting afar, now walked on\n craggy Cynthus, and now kept wandering about the islands and the people in them. Many are\n your temples and wooded groves, and all peaks and towering bluffs ",
        "30":"of lofty mountains and rivers flowing to the sea are dear to you, Phoebus, yet in\n Delos do you most delight your heart; for\n there the long robed Ionians gather in your honor with their children and shy wives: with\n boxing and dancing and song, ",
        "31":"mindful, they delight you so often as they hold their gathering. A man would say\n that they were deathless and unageing if he should then come upon the Ionians so met\n together. For he would see the graces of them all, and would be pleased in heart gazing at\n the men and well-girded women ",
        "32":"with their swift ships and great wealth. And there is this great wonder besides\n —and its renown shall never perish —, the girls of Delos , hand-maidens of the Far-shooter; for when they have praised Apollo\n first, and also Leto and Artemis who delights in arrows, ",
        "33":"they sing a strain telling of men and women of past days, and charm the tribes of\n men. Also they can imitate the tongues of all men and their clattering speech: each would\n say that he himself were singing, so close to truth is their sweet song. ",
        "34":"And now may Apollo be favorable and Artemis; and farewell all you maidens.\n Remember me in after time whenever any one of men on earth, a stranger who has seen and\n suffered much, comes here and asks of you: “Whom think ye, girls, is the sweetest singer\n that comes here, and in whom do you most delight?” ",
        "35":"Then answer, each and all, with one voice: “He is a blind man, and dwells in\n rocky Chios : his lays are evermore supreme.” As\n for me, I will carry your renown as far as I roam over the earth ",
        "36":"to the well-placed cities of man, and they will believe also; for indeed this\n thing is true. And I will never cease to praise far-shooting Apollo, god of the silver\n bow, whom rich-haired Leto bare.",
        "37":"O Lord, Lycia is yours and lovely\n Maeonia \n ",
        "38":"and Miletus , charming city by the\n sea, but over wave-girt Delos you greatly reign\n your own self. Leto's all-glorious son goes to rocky Pytho , playing upon his hollow lyre, clad in divine, perfumed garments; and\n his lyre,",
        "39":"at the touch of the golden key, sings sweet. Thence, swift as thought, he speeds\n from earth to Olympus , to the house of Zeus, to\n join the gathering of the other gods: then straightway the undying gods think only of the\n lyre and song, and all the Muses together, voice sweetly answering voice, ",
        "40":"hymn the unending gifts the gods enjoy and the sufferings of men, all that they\n endure at the hands of the deathless gods, and how they live witless and helpless and\n cannot find healing for death or defence against old age. Meanwhile the rich-tressed\n Graces and cheerful Seasons dance with ",
        "41":"Harmonia and Hebe and Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, holding each other by the\n wrist. And among them sings one, not mean nor puny, but tall to look upon and enviable in\n mien, Artemis who delights in arrows, sister of Apollo. ",
        "42":"Among them sport Ares and the keen-eyed Slayer of Argus, while Apollo plays his\n lyre stepping high and featly and a radiance shines around him, the gleaming of his feet\n and close-woven vest. And they, ",
        "43":"even gold-tressed Leto and wise Zeus, rejoice in their great hearts as they watch\n their dear son playing among the undying gods. How then shall I sing of you —though in all\n ways you are a worthy theme for song? Shall I sing of you as wooer and in the fields of\n love, how you went wooing the daughter of Azan ",
        "44":"along with god-like Ischys the son of well-horsed Elatius, or with Phorbas sprung\n from Triops, or with Ereutheus, or with Leucippus and the wife of Leucippus you on\n foot, he with his chariot, yet he fell not short of Triops. Or shall I sing how at the\n first ",
        "45":"you went about the earth seeking a place of oracle for men, O far-shooting\n Apollo? To Pieria first you went down from Olympus and passed by sandy Lectus and Enienae and through the land of the\n Perrhaebi. Soon you came to Iolcus and set foot on Cenaeum in Euboea , famed for ships: ",
        "46":"you stood in the Lelantine plain, but it pleased not your heart to make a temple\n there and wooded groves. From there you crossed the Euripus, far-shooting Apollo, and went\n up the green, holy hills, going on to Mycalessus and grassy-bedded Teumessus, \n ",
        "47":"and so came to the wood-clad abode of Thebe; for as yet no man lived in holy\n Thebe, nor were there tracks or ways about Thebe's wheat-bearing plain as yet. And further\n still you went, O far-shooting Apollo, ",
        "48":"and came to Onchestus, Poseidon's bright grove: there the new-broken colt\n distressed with drawing the trim chariot gets spirit again, and the skilled driver springs\n from his car and goes on his way. Then the horses for a while rattle the empty car, being\n rid of guidance; ",
        "49":"and if they break the chariot in the woody grove, men look after the horses, but\n tilt the chariot and leave it there; for this was the rite from the very first. And the\n drivers pray to the lord of the shrine; but the chariot falls to the lot of the god.\n Further yet you went, O far-shooting Apollo, ",
        "50":"and reached next Cephissus' sweet stream which pours forth its sweet-flowing\n water from Lilaea, and crossing over it, O worker from afar, you passed many-towered\n Ocalea and reached grassy Haliartus. Then you went towards Telphusa: and there the\n pleasant place seemed fit for ",
        "51":"making a temple and wooded grove. You came very near and spoke to her: “Telphusa,\n here I am minded to make a glorious temple, an oracle for men, and hither they will always\n bring perfect hecatombs, ",
        "52":"both those who live in rich Peloponnesus \n and those of Europe and all the wave-washed\n isles, coming to seek oracles. And I will deliver to them all counsel that cannot fail,\n giving answer in my rich temple.” So said Phoebus Apollo, and laid out all the foundations ",
        "53":"throughout, wide and very long. But when Telphusa saw this, she was angry in\n heart and spoke, saying: “Lord Phoebus, worker from afar, I will speak a word of counsel\n to your heart, since you are minded to make here a glorious temple to be an oracle for men\n who will always ",
        "54":"bring hither perfect hecatombs for you; yet I will speak out, and do you lay up\n my words in your heart. The trampling of swift horses and the sound of mules watering at\n my sacred springs will always irk you, and men will like better to gaze at ",
        "55":"the well-made chariots and stamping, swift-footed horses than at your great\n temple and the many treasures that are within. But if you\n will be moved by me —for you, lord, are stronger and mightier than I, and your strength is\n very great —build at Crisa below the glades of\n Parnassus : ",
        "56":"there no bright chariot will clash, and there will be no noise of swift-footed\n horses near your well-built altar. But so the glorious tribes of men will bring gifts to\n you as Iepaeon (‘Hail-Healer’), and you will receive with delight rich sacrifices from the\n people dwelling round about.” ",
        "57":"So said Telphusa, that she alone, and not the Far-Shooter, should have renown\n there; and she persuaded the Far-Shooter. Further yet you went, far-shooting Apollo, until\n you came to the town of the presumptuous Phlegyae who dwell on this earth ",
        "58":"in a lovely glade near the Cephisian lake, caring not for Zeus. And thence you\n went speeding swiftly to the mountain ridge, and came to Crisa beneath snowy Parnassus , a\n foothill turned towards the west: a cliff hangs over it from above, and a hollow, rugged\n glade runs under.",
        "59":"There the lord Phoebus Apollo resolved to make his lovely temple, and thus he\n said: “In this place I am minded to build a glorious temple to be an oracle for men, and\n here they will always bring perfect hecatombs, ",
        "60":"both they who dwell in rich Peloponnesus \n and the men of Europe and from all the\n wave-washed isles, coming to question me. And I will deliver to them all counsel that\n cannot fail, answering them in my rich temple.” When he had said this, Phoebus Apollo laid\n out all the foundations ",
        "61":"throughout, wide and very long; and upon these the sons of Erginus, Trophonius\n and Agamedes, dear to the deathless gods, laid a footing of stone. And the countless\n tribes of men built the whole temple of wrought stones, to be sung of for ever. ",
        "62":"But near by was a sweet flowing spring, and there with his strong bow the lord,\n the son of Zeus, killed the bloated, great she-dragon, a fierce monster wont to do great\n mischief to men upon earth, to men themselves and to their thin-shanked sheep; for she was\n a very bloody plague. \n ",
        "63":"She it was who once received from gold-throned Hera and brought up fell, cruel\n Typhaon to be a plague to men. Once on a time Hera bare him because she was angry with\n father Zeus, when the Son of Cronos bare all-glorious Athena in his head. Thereupon\n queenly Hera was angry ",
        "64":"and spoke thus among the assembled gods: “Hear from me, all gods and goddesses,\n how cloud-gathering Zeus begins to dishonor me wantonly, when he has made me his\n true-hearted wife. See now, apart from me he has given birth to bright-eyed Athena ",
        "65":"who is foremost among all the blessed gods. But my son Hephaestus whom I bare ",
        "66":"was weakly among all the blessed gods and shrivelled of foot, a shame and a\n disgrace to me in heaven, whom I myself took in my hands and cast out so that he fell in\n the great sea. But silver-shod Thetis the daughter of Nereus ",
        "67":"took and cared for him with her sisters: would that she had done other service to\n the blessed gods! O wicked one and crafty! What else will you now devise? How dared you by\n yourself give birth to bright-eyed Athena? Would not I have borne you a child —I, who was\n at least called your wife ",
        "68":"among the undying gods who hold wide heaven. ",
        "69":"Beware now lest I devise some evil thing for you hereafter: yes, now I will\n contrive that a son be born me to be foremost among the undying gods —and that without\n casting shame on the holy bond of wedlock between you and me. ",
        "70":"And I will not come to your bed, but will consort with the blessed gods far off\n from you.” When she had so spoken, she went apart from the gods, being very angry. Then\n straightway large-eyed queenly Hera prayed, striking the ground flatwise with her hand,\n and speaking thus: ",
        "71":"“Hear now, I pray, Earth and wide Heaven above and you Titan gods who dwell\n beneath the earth about great Tartarus, and from whom are sprung both gods and men! Harken\n you now to me, one and all, and grant that I may bear a child apart from Zeus, no wit\n lesser than him in strength —nay, let him be as much stronger than Zeus as all-seeing Zeus\n than Cronos.” ",
        "72":"Thus she cried and lashed the earth with her strong hand. Then the life-giving\n earth was moved: and when Hera saw it she was glad in heart, for she thought her prayer\n would be fulfilled. And thereafter she never came to the bed of wise Zeus for a full year, ",
        "73":"nor to sit in her carved chair as aforetime to plan wise counsel for him, but\n stayed in her temples where many pray, and delighted in her offerings, large-eyed queenly\n Hera. But when the months and days were fulfilled ",
        "74":"and the seasons duly came on as the earth moved round, she bare one neither like\n the gods nor mortal men, fell, cruel Typhaon, to be a plague to men. Straightway\n large-eyed queenly Hera took him and bringing one evil thing to another such, gave him to\n the dragoness; and she received him. ",
        "75":"And this Typhaon used to work great mischief among the famous tribes of men.\n Whosoever met the dragoness, the day of doom would sweep him away, until the lord Apollo,\n who deals death from afar, shot a strong arrow at her. Then she, rent with bitter pangs,\n lay drawing great gasps for breath and rolling about that place. ",
        "76":"An awful noise swelled up unspeakable as she writhed continually this way and\n that amid the wood: and so she left her life, breathing it forth in blood. Then Phoebus\n Apollo boasted over her: “Now rot here upon the soil that feeds man' You at least shall\n live no more to be a fell bane to men ",
        "77":"who eat the fruit of the all-nourishing earth, and who will bring hither perfect\n hecatombs. Against cruel death neither Typhoeus shall avail you nor ill-famed Chimera, but\n here shall the Earth and shining Hyperion make you rot.” ",
        "78":"Thus said Phoebus, exulting over her: and darkness covered her eyes. And the holy\n strength of Helios made her rot away there; wherefore the place is now called Pytho , and men call the lord Apollo by another name,\n Pythian; because on that spot the power of piercing Helios made the monster rot away. ",
        "79":"Then Phoebus Apollo saw that the sweet-flowing spring had beguiled him, and he\n started out in anger against Telphusa; and soon coming to her, he stood close by and spoke\n to her: “Telphusa, you were not, after all, to keep to yourself this lovely place by\n deceiving my mind, ",
        "80":"and pour forth your clear flowing water: here my renown shall also be and not\n yours alone?” Thus spoke the lord, far-working Apollo, and pushed over upon her a crag\n with a shower of rocks, hiding her streams: and he made himself an altar in a wooded grove ",
        "81":"very near the clear-flowing stream. In that place all men pray to the great one\n by the name Telphusian, because he humbled the stream of holy Telphusa. Then Phoebus\n Apollo pondered in his heart what men he should bring in",
        "82":"to be his ministers in sacrifice and to serve him in rocky Pytho . And while he considered this, he became aware of a\n swift ship upon the wine-like sea in which were many men and goodly, Cretans from\n Cnossos , the city of Minos, they who do sacrifice to the prince and announce his\n decrees, ",
        "83":"whatsoever Phoebus Apollo, bearer of the golden blade, speaks in answer from his\n laurel tree below the dells of Parnassus . These men were sailing in their\n black ship for traffic and for profit to sandy Pylos and to the men of Pylos .\n But Phoebus Apollo met them: ",
        "84":"in the open sea he sprang upon their swift ship, like a dolphin in shape, and lay\n there, a great and awesome monster, and none of them gave heed so as to understand ; ",
        "85":"but they sought to cast the dolphin overboard. But he kept shaking the black\n ship every way and making the timbers quiver. So they sat silent in their craft for fear, ",
        "86":"and did not loose the sheets throughout the black, hollow ship, nor lowered the\n sail of their dark-prowed vessel, but as they had set it first of all with oxhide ropes,\n so they kept sailing on; for a rushing south wind hurried on the swift ship from behind.\n First they passed by Malea, ",
        "87":"and then along the Laconian coast they came to Taenarum, sea-garlanded town and\n country of Helios who gladdens men, where the thick-fleeced sheep of the lord Helios feed\n continually and occupy a gladsome country. There they wished to put their ship to shore,\n and land ",
        "88":"and comprehend the great marvel and see with their eyes whether the monster would\n remain upon the deck of the hollow ship, or spring back into the briny deep where fishes\n shoal. But the well-built ship would not obey the helm, but went on its way all along\n Peloponnesus : ",
        "89":"and the lord, far-working Apollo, guided it easily with the breath of the breeze.\n So the ship ran on its course and came to Arena and lovely Argyphea and Thryon, the ford\n of Alpheus, and well-placed Aepy and sandy Pylos and the men of Pylos ; ",
        "90":"past Cruni it went and Chalcis and\n past Dyme and fair Elis , where the Epei rule. And at the time when she was making for Pherae,\n exulting in the breeze from Zeus, there appeared to them below the clouds the steep\n mountain of Ithaca , and Dulichium and Same and\n wooded Zacynthus . ",
        "91":"But when they were passed by all the coast of Peloponnesus , then, towards Crisa ,\n that vast gulf began to heave in sight which through all its length cuts off the rich isle\n of Pelops. There came on them a strong, clear west-wind by ordinance of Zeus and blew from\n heaven vehemently, that with all speed ",
        "92":"the ship might finish coursing over the briny water of the sea. So they began\n again to voyage back towards the dawn and the sun: and the lord Apollo, son of Zeus, led\n them on until they reached far-seen Crisa , land\n of vines, and into haven: there the sea-coursing ship grounded on the sands. ",
        "93":"Then, like a star at noonday, the lord, far-working Apollo, leaped from the ship:\n flashes of fire flew from him thick and their brightness reached to heaven. He entered\n into his shrine between priceless tripods, and there made\n a flame to flare up bright, showing forth the splendor of his shafts, so that their\n radiance ",
        "94":"filled all Crisa , and the wives and\n well-girded daughters of the Crisaeans raised a cry at that outburst of Phoebus; for he\n cast great fear upon them all. From his shrine he sprang forth again, swift as a thought,\n to speed again to the ship, bearing the form of a man, brisk and sturdy, ",
        "95":"in the prime of his youth, while his broad shoulders were covered with his hair:\n and he spoke to the Cretans, uttering winged words: “Strangers, who are you? Whence come\n you sailing along the paths of the sea? Are you for traffic, or do you wander at random\n over the sea as pirates do who put ",
        "96":"their own lives to hazard and bring mischief to men of foreign parts as they\n roam? Why rest you so and are afraid, and do not go ashore nor stow the gear of your black\n ship? For that is the custom of men who live by bread, whenever they come to land in their\n dark ships from the main, ",
        "97":"spent with toil: at once desire for sweet food catches them about the heart.” So\n speaking, he put courage in their hearts, and the master of the Cretans answered him and\n said: “Stranger —though you are nothing like mortal men ",
        "98":"in shape or stature, but are as the deathless gods —hail and all happiness to\n you, and may the gods give you good. Now tell me truly that I may surely know it: what\n country is this, and what land, and what men live herein? As for us, with thoughts set\n otherwards, we were sailing over the great sea ",
        "99":"to Pylos from Crete (for from there we declare that we are sprung), but\n now are come on shipboard to this place by no means willingly —another way and other paths\n —and gladly would we return. But one of the deathless gods brought us here against our\n will.” Then far-working Apollo answered them and said: ",
        "100":"“Strangers who once dwelt about wooded Cnossos but now shall return no more each to his loved city and fair house\n and dear wife; here shall you keep my rich temple that is honored by many men. ",
        "101":"I am the son of Zeus; Apollo is my name: but you I brought here over the wide\n gulf of the sea, meaning you no hurt; nay, here you shall keep my rich temple that is\n greatly honored among men, and you shall know the plans of the deathless gods, and by\n their will ",
        "102":"you shall be honored continually for all time. And now come, make haste and do as\n I say. First loose the sheets and lower the sail, and then draw the swift ship up upon the\n land. Take out your goods and the gear of the straight ship, ",
        "103":"and make an altar upon the beach of the sea: light fire upon it and make an\n offering of white meal. Next, stand side by side around the altar and pray: and in as much as at the first on the hazy sea I sprang upon the\n swift ship in the form of a dolphin, ",
        "104":"pray to me as Apollo Delphinius; also the altar itself shall be called Delphinius\n and overlooking for ever. Afterwards, sup beside your dark ship and pour\n an offering to the blessed gods who dwell on Olympus . But when you have put away craving for sweet food, ",
        "105":"come with me singing the hymn Ie Paean (Hail, Healer!), until you come to the\n place where you shall keep my rich temple.” So said Apollo. And they readily harkened to\n him and obeyed him. First they unfastened the sheets and let down the sail and lowered the\n mast by the forestays upon the mast-rest. ",
        "106":"Then, landing upon the beach of the sea, they hauled up the ship from the water\n to dry land and fixed long stays under it. Also they made an altar upon the beach of the\n sea, and when they had lit a fire, made an offering of white meal, ",
        "107":"and prayed standing around the altar as Apollo had bidden them. Then they took\n their meal by the swift, black ship, and poured an offering to the blessed gods who dwell\n on Olympus . And when they had put away craving\n for drink and food, they started out with the lord Apollo, the son of Zeus, to lead them, ",
        "108":"holding a lyre in his hands, and playing sweetly as he stepped high and featly.\n So the Cretans followed him to Pytho , marching in\n time as they chanted the Ie Paean after the manner of the Cretan paean-singers and of\n those in whose hearts the heavenly Muse has put sweet-voiced song. ",
        "109":"With tireless feet they approached the ridge and straightway came to Parnassus and the lovely place where they were to dwell\n honored by many men. There Apollo brought them and showed them his most holy sanctuary and\n rich temple. But their spirit was stirred in their dear breasts, ",
        "110":"and the master of the Cretans asked him, saying: “Lord, since you have brought us\n here far from our dear ones and our fatherland, —for so it seemed good to your heart,—tell\n us now how we shall live. That we would know of you. This land is not to be desired either\n for vineyards or for pastures ",
        "111":"so that we can live well thereon and also minister to men.” Then Apollo, the son of Zeus, smiled upon them and said: “Foolish mortals\n and poor drudges are you, that you seek cares and hard toils and straits! Easily will I\n tell you a word and set it in your hearts. ",
        "112":"Though each one of you with knife in hand should slaughter sheep continually, yet\n would you always have abundant store, even all that the glorious tribes of men bring here\n for me. But guard you my temple and receive the tribes of men that gather to this place, ",
        "113":"and especially show mortal men my will, and do you keep righteousness in your\n heart. ",
        "114":"But if any shall be disobedient and pay no heed to my warning, ",
        "115":"or if there shall be any idle word or deed and outrage as is common among mortal\n men, then other men shall be your masters and with a strong hand shall make you subject\n for ever. All has been told you: do you keep it in your heart.” ",
        "116":"And so, farewell, son of Zeus and Leto; but I will remember you and another hymn\n also. "
