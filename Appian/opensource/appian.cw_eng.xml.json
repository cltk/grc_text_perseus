He transferred the courts of justice,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had become discredited by reason of bribery, from the senators to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknights, reproaching the former especially with the recent examples of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAurelius Cotta, Salinator, and, third in the list, Manius Aquilius (the one\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho subdued ), all notorious\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbribe-takers, who had been acquitted by the judges, although ambassadors\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent to complain against them were still present, going around uttering\n\t\t\t\t\t\thateful accusations against them. The Senate was extremely ashamed of these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthings and yielded to the law, and the people ratified it. In this way were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe courts of justice transferred from the Senate to the knights. It is said\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat soon after the passage of this law Gracchus remarked that he had broken\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe power of the Senate once for all. This saying of Gracchus has been even\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore confirmed by experience in the course of events. This power of sitting\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin judgment on all Romans and Italians, including the senators themselves,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin all matters as to property, civil rights, and banishment, exalted the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknights like rulers over them and put senators on the same level with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubjects. Moreover, as the knights voted in the election to sustain the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower of the tribunes, and obtained from them whatever they wanted in\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn, they became more and more formidable to the senators. So it shortly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcame about that the political mastery was turned upside down, the power\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing in the hands of the knights, and the honor only remaining  with the Senate. The knights went so far that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot only held power over the senators, but they openly flouted them beyond\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir right. They also became addicted to bribe-taking, and having once\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttasted these enormous gains, they indulged in them even more basely and\n\t\t\t\t\t\timmoderately than the senators had done. They suborned accusers against the rich and did away with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprosecutions for bribe-taking altogether, partly by concert of action and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpartly by force and violence, so that the practice of this kind of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvestigation became entirely obsolete.

Saturninus brought forward a law to divide the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tland which the Cimbri (a Celtic tribe lately driven out  by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarius) had seized in the country now called  by the Romans, and which was considered as no longer\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGallic but Roman territory.

Thus they intended to punish those who should take it with a bad\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrace, and especially Metellus, who was too high-spirited to submit to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\toath. Such was the proposed law. Saturninus appointed the day for holding\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe comitia and sent messengers to summon from the country districts those\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin whom he had most confidence, because they had served in the army under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarius. As the law gave the larger share to the Italian allies the city\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople were not pleased with it."}, "Sedition broke out in the comitia. Those who attempted to prevent the passage\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the laws proposed by the tribunes were assaulted by Saturninus and driven\n\t\t\t\t\t\taway from the rostra. The city folks exclaimed that thunder was heard in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassembly, in which case it is not permitted by Roman custom to finish the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbusiness that day. As the adherents of Saturninus persisted nevertheless,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe city people girded themselves, seized whatever clubs they could lay\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir hands on, and dispersed the rustics. The latter were rallied by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSaturninus; they attacked the city folks with clubs, overcame them, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpassed the law. When this was done Marius, in his capacity as consul,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforthwith proposed to the Senate that they consider concerning taking the\n\t\t\t\t\t\toath. Knowing that Metellus was a man of fixed opinion and firm in whatever\n\t\t\t\t\t\the might believe or commit himself to, he gave his own opinion publicly, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeceitfully, saying that he would never willingly take this oath himself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen Metellus had agreed with him in this, and the others had praised them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth, Marius adjourned the Senate. On the fifth day thereafter (the last day\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprescribed in the law for taking the oath) he called them together in haste\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout the tenth hour, saying that he was afraid of the people because they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere so zealous for the law. He saw a way, however, to avoid it, and he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproposed the following trick--to swear that they would obey the law as far\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas it was a law, and thus at once disperse the country people by stratagem.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfterward it could be easily shown that this thing, which had been enacted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby violence and in spite of thunder, contrary to the custom of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tancestors, was not a law.", "After speaking thus he did not wait for the result, but while all were in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsilent amazement at the plot, and confused because there was no time to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlost and no opportunity for thinking, he rose and went to the temple of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSaturn, where the qustors were accustomed to administer oaths,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand took the oath first with his friends. The rest followed his example, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach one feared for his own safety. Metellus alone refused to swear, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstood fearlessly by his first determination. Saturninus proceeded against\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim at once on the next day. He sent an officer for him and dragged him out\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the senate-house. As the other tribunes defended him Glaucia and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSaturninus hastened to the country people and told them that they would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnever get the land, and that the law would not be executed, unless Metellus\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere banished. They proposed a decree of banishment against him and directed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe consuls to interdict fire and water and shelter to him, and appointed a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tday for the ratification of this decree. Great was the indignation of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity people, who constantly escorted Metellus, carrying daggers. He thanked\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem and praised them for their good intentions, but said that he could not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallow any danger to befall the country on his account. After saying this he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithdrew from the city. Saturninus got the decree ratified, and Marius made\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproclamation that it was a part of the law.", "In this way was Metellus, a most admirable man, sent into banishment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThereupon Saturninus was made tribune a third time and he had for a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolleague one who was thought to be a fugitive slave, but who claimed to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta son of the elder Gracchus. The multitude supported him in the election\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause they regretted Gracchus. When the election for consuls came on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarcus Antonius was chosen as one of them by common consent. The aforesaid\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGlaucia and Memmius contended for the other place. Memmius was the more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tillustrious man by far, and Glaucia and Saturninus were fearful of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresult. So they sent a gang of ruffians to attack him with clubs while the\n\t\t\t\t\t\telection was going on. They fell upon him in the midst of the comitia and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeat him to death in the sight of all. The assembly was broken up in terror.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNeither laws nor courts nor sense of shame remained. The people ran together\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin anger the following day intending to kill Saturninus, but he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollected another mob from the country and, with Glaucia and Gaius Saufeius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe qustor, seized the Capitol. The Senate voted them public\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies. Marius was vexed; nevertheless he armed some of his forces\n\t\t\t\t\t\treluctantly, and, while he was delaying, some other persons cut off the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twater-supply from the Capitoline temple. Saufeius was near perishing with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthirst and proposed to set the temple on fire, but Glaucia and Saturninus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho hoped that Marius would assist them, surrendered first, and after them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSaufeius. As everybody demanded that they should be put to death, Marius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshut them up in the senate-house as though he intended to deal with them in\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta more legal manner. The crowd considered this a mere pretext. They tore the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttiles off the roof and stoned them to death, including a qustor,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta tribune, and a prtor, who were still wearing their insignia of\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffice.", {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "HW", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Y.R. 655"}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "HW", "@place": "marg", "date": {"@value": "-99", "#text": "99"}, "#text": "B.C."}], "#text": "Very many others were swept out of existence in this sedition.

It seems that the ancient Romans, like the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGreeks, abhorred the taking of interest on loans as something knavish, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\thard on the poor, and leading to contention and enmity; and by the same kind\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof reasoning the Persians considered lending itself as having a tendency\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t to deceit and lying. But, since time had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsanctioned the practice of taking interest, the creditors demanded it\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccording to custom. The debtors, on the other hand, put off the payment by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcausing war and civil commotion. Some indeed threatened to visit the legal\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpenalty on the interest-takers. The prtor Asellio, who had charge\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof these matters, as he was not able to compose their differences by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersuasion, allowed them to proceed against each other in the courts, thus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbringing the conflict of law and custom before the judges. The lenders,\n\t\t\t\t\t\texasperated that the old law should be revived, killed the prtor\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the following manner. He was offering sacrifice to Castor and Pollux in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe forum, with a crowd standing around as was usual at such a ceremony. In\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe first place somebody threw a stone at him. He dropped the libation-bowl\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand ran toward the temple of Vesta. They got ahead of him and prevented him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom reaching the temple, and after he had fled into a certain tavern they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcut his throat.

The Senate offered a reward of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoney to any free person, and freedom to any slave, and impunity to any\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccomplice, who should give testimony leading to the conviction of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmurderers of Asellio, but nobody gave any information.

When Mithridates, king of Pontus and of other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnations, invaded Bithynia and Phrygia and that part of Asia adjacent to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose countries, as I have related in the preceding book, the consul Sulla\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas chosen by lot to the command of Asia and the Mithridatic war, but was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill in Rome. Marius thought that this would be an easy and lucrative war\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand he desired the command of it. So he prevailed upon the tribune, Publius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulpicius, by many promises, to help him obtain it. He also led the new\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItalian citizens, who had very little power in the elections, to hope that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey should be distributed among all the tribes--not putting forward\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanything concerning his own advantage, but with the expectation of employing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem as loyal servants in his every  attempt. Sulpicius straightway brought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforward a law for  this purpose. If it were enacted Marius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Sulpicius would have everything they wanted, because the new citizens\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfar outnumbered the old ones. The old citizens saw this and opposed the new\n\t\t\t\t\t\tones with all their might. They fought each other with sticks and stones,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the evil increased continually. The consuls, becoming apprehensive, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe day for voting on the law drew near, proclaimed a vacation of many days'\n\t\t\t\t\t\tduration, such as was customary on festal occasions, in order to postpone\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe voting and the danger."}, "Sulpicius would not wait for the vacation's end. He ordered his faction to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcome to the forum with concealed daggers and to do whatever the exigency\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmight require, and not to spare the consuls themselves upon occasion. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\teverything was in readiness he denounced the vacation as illegal and ordered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe consuls, Cornelius Sulla and Quintus Pompeius, to put an end to it at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonce, in order to proceed to the enactment of laws. A tumult arose, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose who had been armed drew their daggers and threatened to kill the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsuls, who were making opposition. Finally Pompeius escaped secretly and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulla withdrew on the pretext of taking advice. In the meantime the son of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius, who was the son-in-law of Sulla, and who was speaking his mind\n\t\t\t\t\t\trather freely, was killed by the Sulpicians. Presently Sulla returned and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tannulled the vacation, but hurried away to Capua, where his army was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstationed, in order to cross over to Asia to take command of the war against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMithridates, for he knew nothing as yet of the designs against himself. As\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe vacation was annulled and Sulla had left the city, Sulpicius enacted his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaw, and Marius, for whose sake it was done, was forthwith chosen commander\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the war against Mithridates in place of Sulla.", {"hi": "To", "#text": "When Sulla heard of this he resolved to decide the question by war. He called\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe army together in a conference. They were eager for the war against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMithridates because it promised much plunder, and they feared that Marius\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould enlist other soldiers instead of themselves. Sulla spoke of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindignity put upon him by Sulpicius and Marius, and while he did not openly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallude to anything else (for he did not dare as yet to mention this kind of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta war), he urged them to be ready to obey his orders. They understood what\n\t\t\t\t\t\the meant, and as they feared lest they should miss the campaign they spoke\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboldly what Sulla had in his mind, and told him to be of good courage, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto lead them to Rome. Sulla was overjoyed and led six legions thither\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforthwith, but all of his superior officers, except one qustor,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tleft him and hastened to the city, because they would not submit to the idea\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof leading an army against their country.

As he was approaching, his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolleague, Pompeius, came to meet him and praised him for what he had done,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor Pompeius was delighted, and coperated with him in every way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs Marius and Sulpicius needed some short interval for preparation, they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent other messengers, in the guise of envoys from the Senate, directing him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot to move his camp nearer than forty stades from the city until they could\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsider of the business in hand. Sulla and Pompeius understood their game\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperfectly and promised to comply, but as soon as the envoys were returning\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey followed them."}, "Sulla took possession of the Clian gate and of the adjoining wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith one legion of soldiers, and Pompeius occupied the Colline gate with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanother. A third advanced to the Sublician bridge, and a fourth remained on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguard in front of the walls. With the remainder Sulla entered the city,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing in appearance and in fact an enemy. The inhabitants round about tried\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto fight him off by hurling missiles from the roofs until he threatened to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tburn the houses; then they desisted. Marius and Sulpicius went, with some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforces they had hastily armed, to meet the invaders near the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsquiline forum, and here a battle took place between the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontending parties, the first that was regularly fought in Rome with trumpet\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand signal under the rules of war, and not at all in the similitude of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfaction fight. To such extremity of evil had the recklessness of party\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrife progressed among them. Sulla's forces were beginning to waver when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulla seized a standard and exposed himself to danger in the foremost ranks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOut of regard for their general and fear of ignominy if they should abandon\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir standard, they rallied at once. Sulla ordered up fresh troops from his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcamp and sent others around by the socalled Suburran road to take the enemy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the rear. The Marians fought feebly against these new-comers, and as they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfeared lest they should be surrounded they called to their aid the other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcitizens who were still fighting from the houses, and proclaimed freedom to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslaves who would share their labors. As nobody came forward they fell into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tutter despair and fled at once out of the city, together with those of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnobility who had coperated with them.", "Sulla advanced to the so-called Via Sacra and there, in sight of everybody,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpunished certain soldiers who had plundered persons on the road. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstationed guards at intervals throughout the city, he and Pompeius keeping\n\t\t\t\t\t\twatch by night. Each kept moving about his own command to see that no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalamity was brought about either by the frightened people or by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvictorious troops: They summoned the people to an assembly at daybreak and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlamented the condition of the republic, which had been so long given over to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemagogues, and said that they had done what they had done as a matter of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnecessity. They proposed that no question should ever again be brought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore the people which had not been previously considered by the Senate, an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tancient practice which had been abandoned long ago. Also that the voting\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould not be by tribes, but by centuries, as King Servius Tullius had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tordained. They thought that by these two measures--namely, that no law\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be brought before the people unless it had been previously before the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate, and that the voting should be controlled by the well-to-do and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsober-minded rather than by the pauper and reckless classes--there would no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger be any starting-point for civil discord. They proposed many other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeasures for curtailing the power of the tribunes, which had become\n\t\t\t\t\t\textremely tyrannical. They enrolled 300 of the best citizens at once in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlist of senators, who had been reduced at that time to a very small number\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand had fallen into contempt for that reason.

While Octavius was still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat home awaiting the result, the news was brought to him that the majority\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the tribunes had vetoed the proposed action, but that the new citizens\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad started a riot, drawn their daggers on the street, and assaulted the\n\t\t\t\t\t\topposing tribunes on the rostra. When Octavius heard this he ran down\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the Via Sacra with a very dense mass of men, burst into the forum\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlike a torrent, pushed through the midst of the crowd, and separated them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe struck terror into them, pushed on to the temple of Castor and Pollux,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand drove Cinna away. His companions fell upon the new citizens without\n\t\t\t\t\t\torders, killed many of them, put the rest to flight, and pursued them to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity gates."}, {"foreign": "flamen Dialis", "#text": "Cinna, who had been emboldened by the numbers of the new citizens to think\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he should conquer, seeing the victory won contrary to his expectation\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the bravery of the few, ran through the city calling the slaves to his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassistance by an offer of freedom. As none responded he hastened to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttowns near by, which had lately been admitted to Roman citizenship, Tibur,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrneste, and the rest as far as Nola, inciting them all to\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevolution and collecting money for the purposes of war. While Cinna was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaking these preparations and plans, certain senators of his party joined\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim, among them Gaius Milo, Quintus Sertorius, and Gaius Marius the younger.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Senate decreed that since Cinna had left the city in danger while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tholding the office of consul, and had offered freedom to the slaves, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould no longer be consul, or even a citizen, and elected in his stead\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLucius Merula, the priest of Jupiter (). It\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis said that this priest alone wore the flamen's cap at all times, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers wearing it only during sacrifices. Cinna proceeded to Capua, where\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere was another Roman army, the officers of which, and the senators who\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere present, he courted. He went to meet them as consul in an assembly,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere he laid down the fasces as though he were a private citizen, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshedding tears, said, \"From you, citizens, I received this authority. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople voted it to me; the Senate has taken it away from me without your\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsent. Although I am the sufferer by this wrong I grieve amid my own\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttroubles equally for your sakes. What need is there that we should solicit\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe favor of the tribes in the elections hereafter? What need have we of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou? Where will be your power in the assemblies, in the elections, in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchoice of consuls? If you do not confirm what you bestow, you will be robbed\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhenever you give your decision.\""}, "He said this to stir them up, and after exciting much pity for himself he\n\t\t\t\t\t\trent his garments, leaped down from the rostra, and threw himself on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tground before them, where he lay a long time. With tears in their eyes they\n\t\t\t\t\t\traised him up; they restored him to the curule chair; they lifted up the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfasces and bade him be of good cheer, as he was consul still, and lead them\n\t\t\t\t\t\twherever he would. At their instance the officers came forward and took the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmilitary oath to support Cinna, and administered it each to the soldiers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunder him. When he had been confirmed in this way he traversed the allied\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcities and stirred them up also, because it was on their account chiefly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat this misfortune had happened to him. They furnished him both money and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers; and many others, even of the aristocratic party in Rome, to whom a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstable form of government was irksome, came and joined him. While Cinna was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthus occupied, the consuls, Octavius and Merula, fortified the city with\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrenches, repaired the walls, and planted engines on them. To raise an army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey sent around to the towns that were still faithful and also to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneighboring Gauls. They also summoned Gnus Pompeius, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproconsul who commanded the army on the Adriatic, to come in haste to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\taid of his country.", "Pompeius came and encamped before the Colline gate. Cinna advanced against\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim and encamped near him. When Gaius Marius heard of these transactions he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsailed to Etruria with his fellow-exiles and about 500 slaves who had joined\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir masters from Rome. Filthy and longhaired, he marched through the towns\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresenting a pitiable appearance, descanting on his battles, his victories\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover the Cimbri, and his six consulships; and what was extremely pleasing to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, promising, and also seeming, to be faithful to their interests in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmatter of the voting. In this way he collected 6000 Etruscans and joined\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCinna, who received him gladly by reason of their common interest in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresent enterprise. After their armies were joined they encamped on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks of the Tiber and divided their forces in three parts: Cinna and Carbo\n\t\t\t\t\t\topposite the city, Sertorius above it, and Marius toward the sea. The two\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlatter threw bridges across the river in order to cut off the city's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfood-supply. Marius captured Ostia and plundered it. Cinna sent a force and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaptured Ariminum in order to prevent an army coming to the city from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubject Gauls.", "The consuls were alarmed. They needed more troops, but they were unable to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcall Sulla because he had already crossed over to Asia. They ordered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCcilius Metellus, who was carrying on the remainder of the Social\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWar against the Samnites, to make peace on the best terms he could, and come\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the rescue of his beleaguered country. Metellus would not agree to what\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Samnites demanded, and when Marius heard of this he made an engagement\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith them to grant all that they asked from Metellus. In this way the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSamnites became allies of Marius. Appius Claudius, a military tribune, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad command of the defences of Rome at the hill called the Janiculum, had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonce received a favor from Marius which the latter now reminded him of, in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsequence of which he admitted him into the city, opening a gate for him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat about daybreak. Then Marius admitted Cinna. They were thrust out by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius and Pompeius, who attacked them together, but a severe\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthunder-storm broke upon the camp of Pompeius, and he was killed by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlightning together with others of the nobility.", "After Marius had stopped the passage of food-supplies from the sea, or by way\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the river above, he hastened to attack the neighboring towns where grain\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas stored for the Romans. He fell upon their garrisons unexpectedly and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaptured Antium, Aricia, Lanuvium, and others. There were some also that\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere delivered up to him by treachery. Having cut off their supplies by land\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin this manner, he advanced boldly against Rome, by the so-called Appian\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWay, before any other supplies were brought to them by another route. He and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCinna, and their lieutenant-generals, Carbo and Sertorius, halted at a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistance of 100 stades from the city and went into camp. Octavius, Crassus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Metellus had taken position against them at the Alban Mount, where they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobserved the enemy's movements. Although they considered themselves superior\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin bravery and numbers, they hesitated to risk hastily their country's fate\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the hazard of a single battle. Cinna sent heralds around the city to\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffer freedom to slaves who would desert to him, and forthwith a large\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber did desert. The Senate was alarmed. Anticipating the most serious\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsequences from the people if the scarcity of corn should be protracted,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit changed its mind and sent envoys to Cinna to treat for peace. The latter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tasked them whether they had come to see him as a consul or as a private\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcitizen. They were at a loss for an answer and went back to the city; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow a large number of freemen flocked to Cinna, some from fear of famine and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers because they had been previously favorable to his party and had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\twaiting to see which way the scales would turn.", "Now Cinna began to despise his enemies and drew near to the wall, halting at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe distance of a stone's throw, where he encamped. Octavius and his party\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere undecided and fearful, and hesitated to attack him on account of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdesertions and the negotiations. The Senate was greatly perplexed and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsidered it a dreadful thing to depose Lucius Merula, the priest of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJupiter, who had been chosen consul in place of Cinna, and who had done\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnothing wrong in his office. Yet on account of the impending danger it\n\t\t\t\t\t\treluctantly sent envoys to Cinna again, and this time as consul. They no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger expected favorable terms, so they only asked that Cinna should swear\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto them that he would abstain from bloodshed. He refused to take the oath,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut he promised nevertheless that he would not willingly be the cause of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanybody's death. He directed, however, that Octavius, who had gone around\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand entered the city by another gate, should keep away from the forum lest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanything should befall him against Cinna's will. This answer he delivered to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe envoys from a high platform in his character as consul. Marius stood\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeside the curule chair silent, but showed by the asperity of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountenance how much murder he would commit. When the Senate had accepted\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese terms and had invited Cinna and Marius to enter (for it was understood\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat all the things that Cinna had subscribed to were the doings of Marius),\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe latter said with a scornful smile that it was not lawful for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanished to enter. Forthwith the tribunes voted to repeal the decree of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanishment against him and all the others who were expelled under the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsulship of Sulla.", "Accordingly Cinna and Marius entered the city and everybody received them\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith fear. Straightway they began to plunder without restraint the goods of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose who were supposed to be of the opposite party. Cinna and Marius had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsworn to Octavius, and the augurs and soothsayers had predicted, that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould suffer no harm, yet his friends advised him to fly. He replied that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould never desert the city while he was consul. So he withdrew from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforum to the Janiculum with the nobility and what was left of his army,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere he occupied the curule chair and wore his robes of office, attended by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlictors as a consul. Here he was attacked by Censorinus with a body of\n\t\t\t\t\t\thorse, and again his friends and the soldiers who stood by him urged him to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfly and brought him a horse, but he disdained even to arise, and awaited\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeath. Censorinus cut off his head and carried it to Cinna, and it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuspended in the forum in front of the rostra, the first head of a consul\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat was so exposed. After him the heads of others who were slain were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuspended there. This shocking custom, which began with Octavius, was not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscontinued, but was handed down to subsequent intestine massacres. Now the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvictors sent out spies to search for their enemies of the senatorial and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tequestrian orders. After the knights were killed no further attention was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpaid to them, but all the heads of senators were exposed in front of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trostra. Neither reverence for the gods, nor the indignation of men, nor the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfear of odium for their acts existed any longer among them. After committing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsavage deeds they turned to hideous sights. They killed remorselessly and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsevered the necks of men already dead, and they paraded these horrors before\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe public eye, either to inspire fear and terror, or for a monstrous\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspectacle.", "Gaius Julius and Lucius Julius, two brothers, Atilius Serranus, Publius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLentulus, Gaius Numatorius, and Marcus Bbius were arrested in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstreet and killed. Crassus was pursued with his son. He anticipated the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpursuers by killing his son, but was himself killed by them. Marcus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntonius, the orator, fled to a certain country place, where he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcealed and entertained by the farmer, who sent his slave to a tavern for\n\t\t\t\t\t\twine of a better quality than he was in the habit of buying. The innkeeper\n\t\t\t\t\t\tasked him why he wanted the better quality. The slave whispered the reason\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto him, bought the wine, and went back. The seller ran and told Marius. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarius heard this he sprang up with joy as though he would rush to do the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeed himself, but he was restrained by his friends. A tribune was despatched\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the house, who sent some soldiers upstairs, whom Antonius, a delightful\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspeaker, entertained with a long discourse. He moved their pity by\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecounting many and various things, until the tribune, who was at a loss to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknow what had happened, rushed into the house and, finding his soldiers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlistening to Antonius, killed him while he was still addressing them, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent his head to Marius.", "Cornutus concealed himself in a hut and was saved by his slaves in an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tingenious way. They found a dead body and placed it on a funeral pile, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen the searchers came they set fire to it and said that they were burning\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe body of their master, who had hanged himself. In this way he was saved\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby his slaves. Quintus Ancharius watched his opportunity till Marius was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabout to offer sacrifice in the Capitol, hoping that the temple would be a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore propitious place for him. But when he approached and saluted Marius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe latter, who was just beginning the sacrifice, ordered the guards to kill\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim in the Capitol forthwith; and his head, with that of the orator\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntonius, and those of others who had been consuls and prtors,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas exposed in the forum. Burial was not permitted to any of the slain. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbodies of such men as these were torn in pieces by birds and dogs.

He had been awaiting the turn of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevents in Liguria, and now offered himself as a volunteer ally with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforce under his command, as he was still a proconsul; for those who have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen chosen to this office retain it till they come back to Rome. After\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMetellus, came Pompey, who not long afterward was surnamed the Great, son of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Pompeius who was killed by lightning and who was supposed to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunfriendly to Sulla. The son removed this suspicion by coming with a legion\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich he had collected from the territory of Picenum on the reputation of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this father, who had been very influential there. A little later he recruited\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo more legions and became Sulla's most useful right-hand man in these\n\t\t\t\t\t\taffairs. So Sulla held him in honor, though still very young; and they say\n\t\t\t\t\t\the rose at the entrance of none other than this youth. After the war was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfinished Sulla sent him to Africa to drive out the party of Carbo and to\n\t\t\t\t\t\trestore Hiempsal (who had been expelled by the Numidians) to his kingdom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor this service Sulla allowed him a triumph over the Numidians, although he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas under age, and was still in the equestrian order. He took his start to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreatness from this beginning, and was sent against Sertorius in Spain and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlater against Mithridates in Pontus. Cethegus also joined Sulla, although\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Cinna and Marius he had been violently hostile to him and had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdriven out of the city with them. He was now a suppliant, and offered his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservices to Sulla in any capacity he might desire.", "Sulla now had plenty of soldiers and a sufficient number of friends of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigher orders, whom he used as lieutenants. He and Metellus, who were both\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproconsuls, marched in advance, for it seems that Sulla, who had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappointed proconsul against Mithridates, had at no time laid down his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommand, although he had been voted a public enemy at the instance of Cinna.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNow Sulla moved against his enemies with a most intense yet concealed\n\t\t\t\t\t\thatred. The people in the city, who had formed a pretty fair judgment of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcharacter of the man, and who remembered his former attack and capture of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe city, and who took into account the decrees they had proclaimed against\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim, and who had witnessed the destruction of his house, the confiscation of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this property, the killing of his friends, and the narrow escape of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfamily, were in a state of terror. Conceiving that there was no middle\n\t\t\t\t\t\tground between victory and utter destruction, they united with the consuls\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto resist Sulla, but with trepidation. They despatched messengers throughout\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItaly to collect soldiers, provisions, and money, and, as in cases of\n\t\t\t\t\t\textreme peril, they omitted nothing that zeal and earnestness could suggest.", "Gaius Norbanus and Lucius Scipio, who were then the consuls, and with them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCarbo, who had been consul the previous year (all of them moved by equal\n\t\t\t\t\t\thatred of Sulla and more fearful than others because they knew that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere more to blame for what had been done), levied the best possible army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the city, obtained an additional one from Italy, and marched against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulla in detachments. They had 200 cohorts of 500 men each at first, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir forces were considerably augmented afterward. The sympathies of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople were much in favor of the consuls, because the action of Sulla, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas marching against his country, seemed to be that of an enemy, while that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the consuls, even if they were working for themselves, was ostensibly the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcause of the republic. Many persons, too, who knew that they had shared the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguilt of the consuls, and who were believed to share their fears,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoperated with them. They knew very well that Sulla was not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeditating merely prevention, correction, and alarm for them, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdestruction, death, confiscation, and complete extermination. In this they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere not mistaken, for the war ruined everything. From 10,000 to 20,000 men\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere slain in a single battle more than once. Fifty thousand on both sides\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlost their lives around the city, and to the survivors Sulla was unsparing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin severity, both to individuals and to communities, until, finally, he made\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself the undisputed master of the whole Roman government, so far as he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twished or cared to be.", "It seems, too, that divine Providence foretold to them the results of this\n\t\t\t\t\t\twar. Sights terrible and unexpected were observed by many, both in public\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand in private, throughout all Italy. Ancient, awe-inspiring oracles were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremembered. Many monstrous things happened. A mule gave birth to a colt. A\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpregnant woman was delivered of a viper instead of a baby. There was a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsevere earthquake divinely sent and some of the temples in Rome were thrown\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdown (the Romans gave altogether too much attention to such things). The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCapitol, that had been built by the kings 400 years before, burned down, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnobody could discover the cause of the fire. All things seemed to point to a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuccession of slaughters, to the conquest of Italy and of the Romans\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves, to the capture of the city, and a change in the form of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment.", "This war began as soon as Sulla arrived at Brundusium, which was in the 174th\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOlympiad. Considering the magnitude of the work accomplished, its length was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot great, compared with such wars in general, since the combatants rushed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupon each other with the fury of private enemies. For this reason greater\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand more distressing calamities than usual befell the eager participants in\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta short space of time. Nevertheless the war lasted three years in Italy\n\t\t\t\t\t\talone, until Sulla had secured the supreme power, but in Spain it continued\n\t\t\t\t\t\teven after Sulla's death. Battles, skirmishes, sieges, and fighting of all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkinds were numerous throughout Italy, both regular engagements under the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerals and by detachments, and all were noteworthy. The greatest and most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremarkable of them I shall mention in this book. First of all Sulla and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMetellus fought a battle against Norbanus at Canusium and killed 6000 of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmen, while Sulla's loss was seventy, but many of his men were wounded.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNorbanus retreated to Capua."]}, {"@type": "chapter", "@n": "10", "@id": "b1c10", "head": "CHAPTER X", "argument": {"p": "Desertions to Sulla--Sertorius goes to Spain--Success of Sulla's\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGenerals--Continued Victories of Sulla--Murders in Rome--Young Marius\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbesieged in Prneste--More Desertions to Sulla--The Consul\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCarbo flees to Africa--Sulla's Victory at the City Gates--Surrender of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrneste--Suicide of Young Marius"}, "milestone": [{"@n": "85", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "86", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "87", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "88", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "89", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "90", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "91", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "92", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "93", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "94", "@unit": "section"}], "p": [{"foreign": "en masse,", "#text": "While Sulla and Metellus were near Teanum, L.

As nobody came back and no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanswer was returned (for it seems that Norbanus feared lest he should be\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccused by his army in the same way that Scipio had been), Sulla again\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvanced, devastating all hostile territory. Norbanus did the same thing on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother roads. Carbo hastened to the city and caused Metellus, and all the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother senators who had joined Sulla, to be decreed public enemies.

Italy, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill adhered to them, and also from the neighboring Gauls on the Po. Nor\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas Sulla idle. He sent messengers to all parts of Italy that he could\n\t\t\t\t\t\treach, to collect troops by friendship, by fear, by money, and by promises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn this way the remainder of the summer was consumed on both sides."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "HW", "@place": "marg", "date": {"@value": "-82", "#text": "82"}, "#text": "B.C."}, "#text": "The consuls for the following year were Papirius Carbo again and Marius, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnephew of the great Marius, then twenty-seven years of age. At first the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twinter and severe frost kept the combatants apart. At the beginning of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspring, on the banks of the river sis, there was a severe\n\t\t\t\t\t\tengagement lasting from early morning till noon between Metellus and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCarinas, Carbo's lieutenant. Carinas was put to flight after heavy loss,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhereupon all the country thereabout seceded from the consuls to Metellus.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCarbo came up with Metellus and besieged him until he heard that Marius, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother consul, had been defeated in a great battle near Prneste,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen he led his forces back to Ariminum. Pompey hung on his rear doing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdamage. The defeat at Prneste was in this wise. Sulla captured\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe town of  Setia.

When his left wing began to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgive way five cohorts of foot and two of horse decided not to wait for open\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefeat, but lowered their standards together and went over to Sulla.

Pompey overcame Marcius near Sen and plundered the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttown. Sulla, having shut Marius up in Prneste, drew a line of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcircumvallation around the town a considerable distance from it and left the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twork in charge of Lucretius Ofella, as he intended to reduce Marius by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfamine, not by fighting. When Marius saw that his condition was hopeless he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thastened to put his private enemies out of the way. He wrote to Brutus, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity prtor, to call the Senate together on some pretext or other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand to kill Publius Antistius, the other Papirius, Lucius Domitius, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMucius Scvola, the pontifex maximus. Of these the two first were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslain in their seats as Marius had ordered, assassins having been introduced\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto the senate-house for this purpose. Domitius ran out, but was killed at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe door, and Scvola was killed a little farther away. Their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbodies were thrown into the Tiber, for it was now the custom not to bury the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslain. Sulla sent an army to Rome in detachments by different roads with\n\t\t\t\t\t\torders to seize the gates, and if they were repulsed to rendezvous at Ostia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe towns on the way received them with fear and trembling, and the city\n\t\t\t\t\t\topened its gates to them because the people were oppressed by hunger, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause, of present evils, they were accustomed to yield to the ones which\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere immediately weighing upon them.", "When Sulla learned this he came on immediately and established his army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore the gates in the Campus Martius. He went inside himself, all of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\topposite faction having fled. Their property was at once confiscated and\n\t\t\t\t\t\texposed to public sale. Sulla summoned the people to an assembly, where he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlamented the necessity of his present doings and told them to cheer up, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe troubles would soon be over and the government go as it ought. Having\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarranged such matters as were pressing and put some of his own men in charge\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the city, he set out for Clusium, where the war was still raging. In the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeantime a body of Celtiberian horse, sent by the prtors in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpain, had joined the consuls, and there was a cavalry fight on the banks of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe river Glanis. Sulla killed about fifty of the enemy, and then 270 of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCeltiberian horse deserted to him, and Carbo himself killed the rest of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, either because he was angry at the desertion of their countrymen or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he feared similar action on their own part. About the same time\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulla overcame another detachment of his enemies near Saturnia, and Metellus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsailed around toward Ravenna and took possession of the level, wheat-growing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry of Uritanus. Another Sullan division effected an entrance into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNeapolis by treachery in the night, killed all the inhabitants except a few\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho had made their escape, and seized the triremes belonging to the city. A\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsevere battle was fought near Clusium between Sulla himself and Carbo,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlasting all day. Neither party had the advantage when darkness put an end to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe conflict.", "In the plain of Spoletium, Pompey and Crassus, both Sulla's officers, killed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome 3000 of Carbo's men and besieged Carinas, the opposing general. Carbo\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsent renforcements to Carinas, but Sulla learned of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmovement, laid an ambush for them, and killed about 2000 of them on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\troad. Carinas escaped by night during a heavy rain-storm and thick darkness,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand although the besiegers were aware of some movement, they made no\n\t\t\t\t\t\topposition on account of the storm. Carbo sent Marcius with eight legions to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe relief of his colleague, Marius, at Prneste, having heard\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he was suffering from hunger. Pompey fell upon them from ambush in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefile, defeated them, killed a large number, and surrounded the remainder\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton a hill. Marcius made his escape, leaving his fires burning. His army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tblamed him for being caught in an ambush and stirred up an angry mutiny. One\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhole legion marched off under their standards to Ariminum without orders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe rest separated and went home in squads, so that only seven cohorts\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremained with their general. Marcius, having made a mess of it in this way,\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturned to Carbo. However, Marcus Lamponius from Lucania, Pontius Telesinus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Samnium, and Gutta the Capuan, with 70,000 men, hastened to deliver\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarius from the siege, but Sulla occupied a pass which was the only approach\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the place, and blocked the road. Marius now despaired of aid from\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout, and built a citadel in the wide space between himself and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy, within which he collected his soldiers and his engines, and from\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich he attempted to force his way through the besieging army of Lucretius.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe attempt was renewed several days in different ways, but he accomplished\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnothing and was again shut up in Prneste.", "About the same time Carbo and Norbanus went by a short road to attack the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcamp of Metellus in Faventia just before nightfall. There was only one hour\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof daylight left, and there were thick vineyards thereabout. They made their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplans for battle in hot temper and not with good judgment, hoping to take\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMetellus unawares and to stampede him. But they were beaten, both the place\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the time being unfavorable for them. They became entangled in the vines,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand suffered a heavy slaughter, losing some 10,000 men. About 6000 more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeserted, and the rest were dispersed, only 1000 getting back to Ariminum in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgood order. Another legion of Lucanians under Albinovanus, when they heard\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof this defeat, went over to Metellus to the great chagrin of their leader.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs the latter was not able to restrain this impulse of his men, he, for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime, returned to Norbanus. Not many days later he sent secretly to Sulla,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand having obtained a promise of safety from him, if he should accomplish\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanything important, he invited Norbanus and his lieutenants, Gaius Antipater\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Flavius Fimbria (brother of the one who committed suicide in Asia),\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether with such of Carbo's lieutenants as were then present, to a feast.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen they had all assembled except Norbanus (he was the only one who did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcome), Albinovanus killed them all at the banquet and then fled to Sulla.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNorbanus having learned that, in consequence of this disaster, Ariminum and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany other camps in the vicinity were going over to Sulla, and being unable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto rely on the good faith and firm support of any of his friends there\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresent, since he found himself in adversity, took ship as a private\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindividual and sailed to Rhodes.

The Gauls who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinhabited the country lying between Ravenna and the Alps went over to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMetellus  and Lucullus won a victory over another\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbody of Carbo's forces near Placentia.

His left wing was vanquished and fled to the gates. The old\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers on the walls, when they saw the enemy rushing in with their own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmen, dropped the portcullis. It fell upon and killed many soldiers and many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsenators. But the majority, impelled by fear and necessity, turned and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfought the enemy. The fighting continued through the night and a great many\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere killed. The generals, Telesinus and Albinus, were killed and their camp\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas taken.

Prisoners, to the number of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore than 8000, were shot down with darts by Sulla because they were mostly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSamnites.

Hospitality, private friendship, the borrowing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor lending of money, were alike accounted crimes. Now and then one would be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarrested for doing a kindness to a suspect, or merely for being his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompanion on a journey.

This was in the 175th Olympiad according to the Greek calendar, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere were no Olympic games then except races in the stadium, since Sulla\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad carried away the athletes and all the sights and shows to Rome to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcelebrate his victories in the Mithridatic and Italian wars, under the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpretext that the masses needed a breathing-spell and recreation after their\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttoils."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "HW", "@place": "marg", "date": {"@value": "-81", "#text": "81"}, "#text": "B.C."}, "#text": "Nevertheless, as the form of the republic remained  he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallowed them to appoint consuls.

He repealed laws and he enacted others.

He reduced the tribunician\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower to such an extent that it seemed to be destroyed.

I am\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot able to say positively whether Sulla transferred this office from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople to the Senate, where it is now lodged, or not. To the Senate itself,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had been much thinned by the seditions and wars, he added about 300\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmembers from the best of the knights, taking the vote of the tribes for each\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone. To the plebeians he added more than 10,000 slaves of proscribed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersons, choosing the youngest and strongest, to whom he gave freedom and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRoman citizenship, and he called them Cornelii after himself. In this way he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade sure of having 10,000 men among the plebeians always ready to obey his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommands. In order to provide the same kind of safeguard throughout Italy he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistributed to the twenty-three legions that had served under him a great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeal of land among the communities, as I have already related, some of which\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas public property and some taken from the communities by way of fine."}, "So terrible was he and so uncontrollable in anger that he slew in the middle\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the forum Q. Lucretius Ofella, the one who had besieged and captured\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrneste and the consul Marius, and had won the final victory for\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim.

Then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSulla assembled the people and said to them, \"Know, citizens, and learn from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme, that I caused the death of Lucretius because he disobeyed me.\" And then\n\t\t\t\t\t\the told the following story: \"A husbandman was bitten by fleas while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tploughing.

Others took the contrary view, judging from his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacts, and called it \"the tyranny confessed.\"", "Into such evils were the Romans and all the Italians plunged by this war; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso likewise were all the countries beyond Italy by the recent piracies, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the Mithridatic war, or by the many exhausting taxes levied to meet the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeficit in the public treasury due to the seditions. All the allied nations\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand kings, and not only the tributary cities, but those which had delivered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves to the Romans voluntarily under sworn agreements, and those which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby virtue of their furnishing aid in war or for some other merit were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tautonomous and not subject to tribute, all were now required to pay and to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobey. Some that had surrendered themselves under treaty arrangements were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeprived of their territory and their harbors.

He did\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis because the government of Alexandria was destitute of a sovereign in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe male line, and the women of the royal house wanted a man of the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlineage, and because he (Sulla) expected to reap a large reward from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trich kingdom. As Alexander behaved himself in a very offensive manner toward\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, relying upon Sulla, the Alexandrians, on the nineteenth day of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\treign, dragged him from the palace to the gymnasium and put him to death; so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle fear had they of foreigners, either by reason of the magnitude of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir own government or their inexperience as yet of external dangers."]}, {"@type": "chapter", "@n": "12", "@id": "b1c12", "head": "CHAPTER XII", "argument": {"p": "Sulla's Abdication--Character of Sulla--His Death, and Funeral"}, "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "HW", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Y.R. 674"}, "milestone": [{"@n": "103", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "104", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "105", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "106", "@unit": "section"}], "p": [{"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "HW", "@place": "marg", "date": {"@value": "-80", "#text": "80"}, "#text": "B.C."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "HW", "@place": "marg", "#text": "Y.R. 675"}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "HW", "@place": "marg", "date": {"@value": "-79", "#text": "79"}, "#text": "B.C."}], "#text": "The following year Sulla, although he was dictator,  undertook\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe consulship a second time, with Metellus Pius for his colleague, in order\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto preserve the pretence and form of democratic government.

The people, seeing fresh seditions brewing and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfearing two armies encamped round about, besought the consuls, while they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere occupying the curule chairs in the forum, to be reconciled to each\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother. At first both of them repelled these solicitations. When certain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersons, who seemed to be divinely inspired, predicted many direful\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsequences if the consuls did not come to an agreement, the people again\n\t\t\t\t\t\timplored them with lamentation and the greatest dejection, reminding them of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe evils produced by the contentions of Marius and Sulla. Crassus yielded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst. He came down from his chair, advanced to Pompey, and offered him his\n\t\t\t\t\t\thand in the way of reconciliation.

When Ptolemy heard of the decree he threw his money into the sea\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand killed himself, and Cato settled the government of Cyprus.

One of these men, who had held this office and was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsequently considered a Roman citizen, was beaten with rods for some\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason by order of Marcellus in defiance of Csar--a punishment\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat was never inflicted on Roman citizens.

So insulting was Marcellus. Moreover, he proposed to send\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuccessors to take command of Csar's provinces before his time\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad expired, but Pompey interfered, making a pretence of fairness and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgood-will, saying that they ought not to put an indignity on a distinguished\n\t\t\t\t\t\tman who had been so extremely useful to his country, merely on account of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshort interval of time; but he made it plain that Csar's command\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmust come to an end immediately on its expiration.

He knew that he could not carry any\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch measure, but he hoped that Pompey's friends would oppose him so that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmight have that as an excuse for opposing Pompey. Things turned out as he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad anticipated, so that he had a pretext for disagreement. Claudius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproposed the sending of successors to take command of Csar's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovinces, as his term was now expiring. Paulus was silent. Curio, who was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthought to differ from both, praised the motion of Claudius, but added that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey ought to resign his provinces and army just like Csar, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin this way he said the commonwealth would be made free and be relieved from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfear in all directions. Many opposed this as unjust, because Pompey's term\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad not yet expired. Then Curio came out more openly and decidedly against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappointing successors to Csar unless Pompey also should lay down\n\t\t\t\t\t\this command; for since they were both suspicious of each other, he contended\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat there could be no lasting peace to the commonwealth unless both were\n\t\t\t\t\t\treduced to the character of private citizens. He said this because he knew\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Pompey would not give up his command and because he saw that the people\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere incensed against Pompey on account of his prosecutions for bribery. As\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCurio's position was plausible, the plebeians praised him as the only one\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho was willing to incur the enmity of both Pompey and Csar in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder to fulfil worthily his duties as a citizen; and once they escorted him\n\t\t\t\t\t\thome like an athlete, scattering flowers, as though he had won the prize in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome great and difficult contest, for nothing was considered more perilous\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen than to have a difference with Pompey.", {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "HW", "@place": "foot", "title": "Tusculan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDisputations", "#text": "Cicero makes mention of this illness of Pompey in the  (i. 35)."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "HW", "@place": "foot", "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "qusi/as,"}, "#text": "\" sacrificings.\" This refers,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsays Combes-Dounous, to Csar's duties as Pontifex Maximus, a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlife office, to which he had been chosen in his younger days."}], "#text": "Pompey, while lying sick in Italy, wrote an artful letter to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate, praising Csar's exploits and also recounting his own from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe beginning, saying that he had been invested with a third consulship, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith provinces and an army afterward, which he had not solicited, but had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen called to serve the public weal. He added that the powers which he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccepted unwillingly he would gladly yield to those who wished to take them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tback, and would not wait the time fixed for their expiration. The artfulness\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof this communication consisted in showing the fairness of Pompey and in\n\t\t\t\t\t\texciting prejudice against Csar, as though the latter was not\n\t\t\t\t\t\twilling to give up his command even at the appointed time. When Pompey came\n\t\t\t\t\t\tback to the city, he spoke to the senators in the same way and then, also,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpromised to lay down his command. As a friend and marriage connection of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar he said that the latter would very cheerfully do the same,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor his had been a long and laborious contest against very warlike peoples;\n\t\t\t\t\t\the had added much to the Roman power and now he would come back to his\n\t\t\t\t\t\thonors and his sacrificings and\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake his rest. He said these things in order that successors to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar might be sent at once, while he (Pompey) should merely stand\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton his promise. Curio exposed his artifice, saying that promises were not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsufficient, and insisting that Pompey should lay down his command now and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat Csar should not be disarmed until Pompey himself had\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturned to private life. On account of private enmity, he said, it would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot be advisable either for Csar or for the Romans that such\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat authority should be held by one man. Rather should each of them have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower against the other in case one should attempt violence against the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommonwealth. Throwing off all disguise, he denounced Pompey unsparingly as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone aiming at supreme power, and said that unless he would lay down his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommand now, when he had the fear of Csar before his eyes, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould never lay it down at all. He moved that, unless they both obeyed, both\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be voted public enemies and military forces be levied against them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn this way he concealed the fact that he had been bought by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar."}, "Pompey was angry with him and threatened him and at once withdrew indignantly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto his country-seat. The Senate now had suspicions of both, but it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsidered Pompey the better republican of the two, and it hated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar because he had not shown it proper respect during his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsulship. Some of the senators really thought that it would not be safe to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe commonwealth to deprive Pompey of his power until after Csar\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould lay down his, since the latter was outside of the city and was the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tman of more towering designs. Curio held the contrary opinion, that they had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneed of Csar against the power of Pompey, or otherwise that both\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmies should be disbanded at the same time. As the Senate would not agree\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith him he dismissed it, leaving the whole business still unfinished. He\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad the power to do so as tribune. Thus Pompey had occasion to regret that\n\t\t\t\t\t\the had restored the tribunician power to its pristine vigor after it had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen reduced to extreme feebleness by Sulla. Nevertheless, one decree was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvoted before the session was ended, and that was that Csar and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompey should each send one legion of soldiers to Syria to defend the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovince on account of the disaster to Crassus. Pompey artfully recalled.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe legion that he had lately lent to Csar on account of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisaster to Csar's two generals, Titurius and Cotta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar awarded to each soldier 250 drachmas and sent the legion to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRome together with another of his own.

On the approach\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Csar he became alarmed and repented of his deeds, and when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar was within 200 stades he sent ambassadors to him to treat\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor peace.

But, contrary to the expectation of all,\n\t\t\t\t\t\the replied without hesitation, \" I discharge you.\" Then, to their still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreater astonishment, and while the silence was most profound, he added,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"And I will give you all that I have promised when I have my triumph with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers.\" At this expression, as unexpected as it was kind to them, shame\n\t\t\t\t\t\timmediately took possession of all, and reflection, together with jealousy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat the thought of their abandoning their commander in the midst of such\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat wars and of others joining in the triumph instead of themselves, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof their losing the gains of the war in Africa, which were expected to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreat, and becoming enemies of Csar himself as well as of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\topposite party.

They thought that this deed, like\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat one of old, taking place in open Senate, would seem to be performed not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby private plotters, but in behalf of the country, and that, being in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic interest, there would be no danger from Csar's army.

For these reasons they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunanimously chose the Senate as the place, but they were not agreed as to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe mode.

So they decided to watch a future opportunity\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand to try if possible to draw over to themselves the army of Decimus, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas already disheartened by its protracted labors.

They\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreferred to keep a firm hold on what they possessed. Some were opposed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnew elections because they were not of lawful age, or for some other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunavowed reason, and among these was the consul Dolabella himself, who could\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot legally stand for an election to that office as he was only twenty-five\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyears old. Although he had pretended yesterday that he had a share in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconspiracy, a sudden change came over him, and now he reviled the majority\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor seeking to confer honor on murderers and dishonoring their own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmagistrates under the pretext of securing the safety of the former.

Some cried out that the deed must be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tavenged, but a greater number demanded peace.

We all swore the national oaths to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar and we have trampled on them -- we who are considered the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmost distinguished of the oath-takers.\" Then, turning to those who called\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor vengeance, he said, \"Csar, that truly sacred and revered man,\n\t\t\t\t\t\thas gone from us, but we hesitate to deprive the republic of those who still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremain. Our conscript fathers,\" he added, \"are considering these matters,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand this is the opinion of most of them.\" They shouted again, \"Avenge him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyourself.\" \"I would like to,\" he replied, \"and it is right that I should do\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit even alone, but it is not fitting that you and I should wish to do it\n\t\t\t\t\t\talone, or alone set ourselves up against them.\"", "While Lepidus was employing such devices the hirelings, who knew that he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tambitious, praised him and offered him Csar's place as pontifex\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaximus. He was delighted. \"Mention this to me later,\" he said, \"if you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsider me worthy of it,\" whereupon the mercenaries, encouraged by their\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffer of the priesthood, insisted still more strongly on peace. \"Although it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis contrary to religion and law,\" he said, \"I will do what you wish.\" So\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaying he returned to the Senate, where Dolabella had consumed all the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintervening time in unseemly talk about his own office. Antony, who was\n\t\t\t\t\t\twaiting to see what the people would do, looked at Dolabella with derision,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the two were at variance with each other. After enjoying the spectacle\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsufficiently and perceiving that the people would not do anything rashly, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecided, under compulsion, to extend protection to the murderers (concealing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe necessity, however, and pretending to act in this way as a matter of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreatest favor), and at the same time to have Csar's acts\n\t\t\t\t\t\tratified and his plans carried into effect by common agreement. Accordingly\n\t\t\t\t\t\the commanded silence again and spoke as follows:--", "\"Fellow-citizens, while you have been considering the case of the offenders I\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave not joined in the debate. When you called for a vote on Csar\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstead of on them, I had brought forward, until this moment, only one of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar's acts. This one threw you into these many present\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontroversies, and not without reason, for if we resign our offices we shall\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfess that we (so many and of such high rank as we are) came by them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tundeservedly. Consider the matters that cannot be easily controlled by us.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReckon them up by cities and provinces, by kings and princes. Almost all of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese, from the rising to the setting sun, Csar either subdued\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor us by force and arms, or organized by his laws, or confirmed in their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tallegiance by his favors and kindness. Which of these powers do you think\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill consent to be deprived of what they have received, unless you mean to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfill the world with new wars -- you who propose to spare these wretches for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sake of your exhausted country? But, omitting the more distant dangers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand apprehensions, we have others not only near at hand, but even of our own\n\t\t\t\t\t\thousehold throughout Italy itself,-- men who are here after receiving the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trewards of victory, many of them with arms in their hands and in the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\torganization in which they fought, men assigned to colonies by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar (many thousands of whom are still in the city), -- what\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthink you they will do if they are deprived of what they have received, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpect to receive, in town and country?

His gardens were given to the people as a place of\n\t\t\t\t\t\trecreation, and to every Roman still living in the city he gave seventy-five\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAttic drachmas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe people were again stirred to anger when they saw the will of this lover\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof his country, whom they had before heard accused of tyranny. Most of all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdid it seem pitiful to them that Decimus Brutus, one of the murderers,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould have been named by him for adoption in the second degree; for it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcustomary for the Romans to name alternate heirs in case of the failure of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe first. Whereupon there was still greater disturbance among the people,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho considered it shocking and sacrilegious that Decimus should have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconspired against Csar when he had been adopted as his son. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPiso brought Csar's body into the forum a countless multitude ran\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttogether with arms to guard it, and with acclamations and magnificent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisplay placed it on the rostra. Wailing and lamentation were renewed for a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlong time, the armed men clashed their shields, and gradually they began to\n\t\t\t\t\t\trepent themselves of the amnesty. Antony, seeing how things were going, did\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot abandon his purpose, but, having been chosen to deliver the funeral\n\t\t\t\t\t\toration, as a consul for a consul, a friend for a friend, a relative for a\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelative (for he was related to Csar on his mother's side),\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresumed his artful design and spoke as follows:--"}, "\"It is not fitting, citizens, that the funeral oration of so great a man\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould be pronounced by me alone, but rather by his whole country. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecrees which all of us, in equal admiration of his merit, voted to him\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile he was alive -- the Senate and the people acting together -- I will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tread, so that I may voice your sentiments rather than my own.\" Then he began\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto read with a severe and gloomy countenance, pronouncing each sentence\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdistinctly and dwelling especially on those decrees which declared\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar to be superhuman, sacred, and inviolable, and which named\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim the father of his country, or the benefactor, or the chieftain without a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeer. With each decree Antony turned his face and his hand toward\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar's corpse, illustrating his discourse by his action, and at\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach appellation he added some brief remark full of grief and indignation;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas, for example, where the decree spoke of Csar as the father of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this country he added that this was a testimonial of his clemency; and again,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere he was made sacred and inviolable and everybody else was to be held\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunharmed who should find refuge with him,-- \"Nobody,\" said Antony, \"who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfound refuge with him was harmed, but he, whom you declared sacred and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinviolable, was killed, although he did not extort these honors from you as\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta tyrant, and did not even ask for them. Most servile are we if we give such\n\t\t\t\t\t\thonors to the unworthy who do not ask for them. But you, faithful citizens,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvindicate us from this charge of servility by paying such honors as you now\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpay to the dead.\"", "Antony resumed his reading and recited the oaths by which all were pledged to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tguard Csar and Csar's body with all their strength,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand all were devoted to perdition who should not avenge him against any\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconspiracy. Here, lifting up his voice and extending his hand toward the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCapitol, he exclaimed, \"Jupiter, guardian of this city, and ye other gods, I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstand ready to avenge him as I have sworn and vowed, but since those who are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof equal rank with me have considered the decree of amnesty beneficial, I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpray that it may prove so.\" A commotion arose among the senators in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsequence of this exclamation, which seemed to have special reference to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem. So Antony quieted them again and recanted, saying, \"It seems to me,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfellow-citizens, that this deed is not the work of human beings, but of some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevil spirit. It becomes us to consider the present rather than the past,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince the greatest danger approaches, if it is not already here, lest we be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrawn into our former civil commotions and lose whatever remains of noble\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbirth in the city.

It happened to Alexander when he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamong the Oxydrac and while he was leading his Macedonians in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscaling the enemy's wall. The ladder broke, leaving him alone on the top.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTaking counsel of his courage, he leaped inside the town against his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies, and was struck severely in the breast and on the neck by a very\n\t\t\t\t\t\theavy club, so that he fell down, and was rescued with difficulty by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMacedonians, who broke down the gates in their alarm for him. It happened to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar in Spain while his army was in great fear of young Pompey,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand hesitated to join battle. Csar dashed in advance of all into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe space between the armies, and received 200 darts on his shield until his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy, moved by shame and fear for his safety, rushed forward and rescued\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim. Thus in the case of each the first victims without livers presaged\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdanger of death; the second presaged death itself. As Peithagoras, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoothsayer, was inspecting the entrails, he told Apollodorus, who was in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfear of Alexander and Hephestion, not to be afraid of them, because they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould both be out of the way very soon. Hephestion died immediately, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApollodorus, being apprehensive lest some conspiracy might exist against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexander, communicated the prophecy to him. Alexander smiled, and asked\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPeithagoras himself what the prodigy meant. When the latter replied that it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeant fatality, he smiled again.

I should have owed you thanks for this\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso, had you not immediately voted them Cyrenaica ana Crete; had you not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreferred these fugitives for governorships, where they can always defend\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves against me, and had you not tolerated Decimus Brutus in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommand of Hither Gaul, although he, like the rest, was one of my father's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslayers. It may be said that these were decrees of the Senate. But you put\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe vote and you presided over the Senate -- you who ought most of all to\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave opposed them on your own account. To grant amnesty to the murderers was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmerely to insure their personal safety as a matter of favor, but to vote\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem provinces and rewards forthwith was to insult Csar and annul\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour own opinion. Grief has compelled me to speak these words, against the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trules of decorum perhaps, considering my youth and the respect I owe you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey have been spoken, however, to the firmest friend of Csar, to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone who was invested by him with the greatest honor and power, and who would\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave been adopted by him no doubt if he had known that you would accept\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkinship with the family of neas in exchange for that of Hercules;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor this created doubt in his mind when he was thinking strongly of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdesignating you as his successor.", "\"For the future, Antony, I conjure you by the gods who preside over\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriendship, and by Csar himself, to change somewhat the measures\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat have been adopted, for you can change them if you wish to; if not, that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou will hereafter aid and cooperate with me in punishing the murderers,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith the help of the people and of those who are still my father's faithful\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriends. If you still have regard for the conspirators and the Senate, do\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot be hard on us. So much for that. You know about my private affairs and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe expense I must incur for the legacy which my father directed to be given\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the people, and the haste involved in it lest I may seem churlish by\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason of delay, and lest those who have been assigned to colonies be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompelled to remain in the city and waste their time on my account. Of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar's movables, that were brought immediately after the murder\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom his house to yours as a safer place, I beg you to take keepsakes and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanything else by way of ornament and whatever you like to retain from us.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut in order that I may pay the legacy to the people, please give me the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgold coin that Csar had collected for his intended wars. That\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill suffice for the distribution to 300,000 men now. For the rest of my\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpenses I may perhaps borrow from you, if I may be so bold, or from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic treasury on your security, if you will give it, and I will offer my\n\t\t\t\t\t\town property for sale at once.\"", "While Octavius was speaking in this fashion Antony was astonished at his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfreedom of speech and his boldness, which seemed much beyond the bounds of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpropriety and of his years. He was offended by the words because they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\twanting in the respect due to him, and still more by the demand for money,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand, accordingly, he replied in the severe terms following: \"Young man, if\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar left you the government, together with the inheritance and\n\t\t\t\t\t\this name, it is proper for you to ask and for me to give the reasons for my\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic acts. But if the Roman people never surrendered the government to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanybody to dispose of in succession, not even when they had kings, whom they\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpelled and swore never to have any more (this was the very charge that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmurderers brought against your father, saying that they killed him because\n\t\t\t\t\t\the was no longer leading but reigning), then there is no need of my\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanswering you as to my public acts. For the same reason I release you from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tany indebtedness to me in the way of gratitude for those acts. They were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperformed not as a favor to you, but to the people, except in one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticular, which was of the greatest importance to Csar and to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyourself. For if, to secure my own safety and to shield myself from enmity,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI had allowed honors to be voted to the murderers as tyrannicides,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar would have been declared a tyrant, to whom neither glory,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnor any kind of honor, nor confirmation of his acts would have been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossible; who could make no valid will, have no son, nor any burial of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbody, even as a private citizen. The laws provide that the bodies of tyrants\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshall be cast out unburied, their memory stigmatized, and their property\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfiscated.", "\"Apprehending all of these consequences, I entered the lists for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar, for his immortal honor, and his public funeral, not without\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdanger, not without incurring hatred to myself, contending against\n\t\t\t\t\t\thot-headed, blood-thirsty men, who, as you know, had already conspired to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkill me; and against the Senate, which was displeased with your father on\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount of his usurped authority. But I willingly chose to incur these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdangers and to suffer anything rather than allow Csar to remain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunburied and dishonored -- the most valiant man of his time, the most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfortunate in every respect, and the one to whom the highest honors were due\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom me. It is by reason of the dangers I incurred that you enjoy your\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresent distinction as the successor of Csar, his family, his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tname, his dignity, his wealth. It was more becoming in you to testify your\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgratitude to me for these things than to reproach me for concessions made to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoothe the Senate, or in compensation for what I demanded of it, or in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpursuance of other needs or reasons -- you a younger man addressing an older\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone.

They awarded him a gilded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstatue and the right to declare his opinion among the consulars in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate even now, and the right to stand for the consulship itself ten years\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore the legal period, and voted from the public treasury to the legions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat deserted from Antony to him the same amount that he had promised to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgive them if they should be victorious. After passing these decrees they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadjourned, thinking that Antony would in fact know from the votes taken that\n\t\t\t\t\t\the was declared a public enemy and believing, also, that on the following\n\t\t\t\t\t\tday the tribune would no longer interpose his veto. The mother, the wife,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the son of Antony (who was still a young man), and his other relatives\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand friends went around the whole night visiting the houses of influential\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmen and beseeching them. In the morning they put themselves in the way of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose going to the senate-house, fell at their feet with wailing and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlamentation and in mourning garments, crying out alongside the doors. Some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the senators were moved by these cries, this spectacle, this so sudden\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchange of fortune. Cicero, fearing the result, addressed the Senate as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollows: --"}, "\"What decision ought to be reached concerning Antony we determined yesterday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen we bestowed honors on his enemies we thereby voted him an enemy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSalvius, who alone interrupted the proceedings, must either have been wiser\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan all the rest, or moved to do so by private friendship, or by ignorance\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof present circumstances. It would be most disgraceful to us, on the one\n\t\t\t\t\t\thand, if all should seem to know less than one, and to Salvius, on the other\n\t\t\t\t\t\thand, if he should prefer private friendship to the public weal. If he is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot well acquainted with the present circumstances he ought to repose\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfidence in the consuls, rather than in himself, in the prtors,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin his fellow-tribunes, and the other senators, so imposing in dignity and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin numbers, so much his superiors in age and experience, who have condemned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony. In our elections and in our jury trials justice is ever on the side\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the majority. If it be needful still to acquaint him with the reasons for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour action I will briefly recount the principal ones by way of reminder. At\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar's death Antony possessed himself of our money. Having been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvested with the government of Macedonia by us he seized upon that of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCisalpine Gaul without our authority. Having received an army to operate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the Thracians he brought it into Italy against us instead. Each of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese powers with his own secret motives he asked from us, and when they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere refused he acted on his own authority. At Brundusium he organized a\n\t\t\t\t\t\troyal cohort for his own use and openly made men-at-arms his private guards\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand night watchmen, serving under a countersign. The whole remainder of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy he led from Brundusium to the city, aiming by a shorter path at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame designs that Csar contemplated. Being anticipated by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyounger Csar and his army he became alarmed and turned his course\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the Gallic province as a convenient point of attack on us, just as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar found it when he made himself our master.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "HW", "@place": "foot", "#text": "The fifth Philippic of Cicero was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdelivered in the Senate on the first day of January, 711, and the sixth\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto a popular assembly on the fourth day of the same month.

Then the rewards voted only to those of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers who had deserted from Antony to him were an indignity to those who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad enlisted under him.

There were frequent cavalry engagements, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony had a much larger force of horse, but the difficulty of the ground,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was cut up by torrents, deprived him of the advantage of numbers.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "HW", "@place": "foot", "#text": "This tale, in so far\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas it relates to Cicero, must be entirely fictitious, since nothing of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe kind is mentioned in the Philippics, although Ventidius is mentioned\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttwice after his supposed march upon Rome to arrest Cicero."}, "#text": "Such was the course of events around Mutina. At Rome, in the absence of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsuls, Cicero took the lead by public speaking. He held frequent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassemblies, procured arms by inducing the artificers to work without pay,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollected money, and exacted heavy contributions from the Antonians. These\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpaid without complaining in order to avoid calumny, until Publius Ventidius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho had served under Gaius Csar and was a friend of Antony,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunable to endure the exactions of Cicero, betook himself to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar's colonies, where he was well known, and raised two legions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor Antony and hastened to Rome to seize Cicero. The consternation was\n\t\t\t\t\t\textreme. They removed most of the women and children in a panic, and Cicero\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself fled from the city. When Ventidius learned this he turned his course\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttoward Antony, but being intercepted by Octavius and Hirtius, he proceeded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Picenum, where he recruited another legion and waited to see what would\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thappen.

At daybreak, with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly the Martian legion and five other cohorts, they entered upon the road\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabove mentioned, which was still free from enemies, and looked over the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarsh on either side. There was a suspicious agitation of the bushes, then a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgleaming of shields and helmets, and Antony's prtorian cohort\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuddenly showed itself directly in their front. The Martian legion,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurrounded on all sides and having no way to escape, ordered the new levies,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif they came up, not to join in the fight lest they should cause confusion\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby their inexperience. The prtorians of Octavius confronted the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprtorians of Antony. The other troops divided themselves in two\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparts and advanced into the marsh on either side, the one commanded by Pansa\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the other by Carsuleius. Thus there were two battles in two marshes, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneither division could see the other by reason of the elevated road, while\n\t\t\t\t\t\talong the road itself the praetorian cohorts fought another battle of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\town. The Antonians were determined to punish the Martians for desertion as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing traitors to themselves. The Martians were equally determined to punish\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Antonians for condoning the slaughter of their comrades at Brundusium.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecognizing in each other the flower of either army they hoped to decide the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhole war by this single engagement. The one side was moved by shame lest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tits two legions should be beaten by one; the other by ambition that its\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsingle legion should overcome the two.", "Thus urged on rather by their own animosity and ambition than by their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerals they assailed each other, considering this their own affair.

As there could be neither flanking nor charging in marshes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand ditches, they stood together in close order, and since neither could\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdislodge the other they locked together with their swords as in a wrestling\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmatch. No blow missed its mark. There were wounds and slaughter but no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcries, only groans; and when one fell he was instantly borne away and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanother took his place. They needed neither admonition nor encouragement,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince experience had made each one his own general. When they were overcome\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby fatigue they drew apart from each other for a brief space to take breath,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas in gymnastic games, and then rushed again to the encounter. Amazement\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttook possession of the new levies who had come up, as they beheld such deeds\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdone with such precision and in such silence.", "All put forth superhuman exertions, and the prtorians of Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperished to the last man.

The new levies dashed into it confusedly although\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey were Italians, the same as the Martians, so much more than race does\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttraining contribute to bravery. The Martians for fear of shame did not enter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto the camp, but ranged themselves near it. Although fatigued they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill furious and ready to fight to the bitter end if anybody should attack\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem.

Being disdained by the Senate as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough he were seeking honors beyond his years, he began to fear lest if\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony were destroyed he should be despised still more, and so he desired a\n\t\t\t\t\t\treconciliation with Antony, as Pansa on his death-bed had recommended to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thim.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAccordingly, he began to make friends of those of Antony's army who had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttaken prisoners, both officers and soldiers.

It seems that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlutarch drew his information, either directly or indirectly, from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmemoirs of Octavius, which were extant in his time.

The death of the two\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsuls had left Rome at the mercy of half a dozen commanders in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfield, who could not be controlled by the Senate. Under such\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcircumstances Cicero might have grasped at the consulship in conjunction\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith Octavius, without the motive of personal ambition.

This\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas a preliminary step to annulling Csar's arrangements, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony had done little or nothing himself, but had conducted all the affairs\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof state in accordance with Csar's memoranda.

The Pompeians also sought the consulship\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the remainder of the year in place of Hirtius and Pansa. But Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\talso sought it, applying not to the Senate, but to Cicero privately, whom he\n\t\t\t\t\t\turged to become his colleague, saying that Cicero should carry on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment, as he was the elder and more experienced, and that he (Octavius)\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould enjoy the title only, by which means he could dismiss his army in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecoming manner, for which reason he had previously asked the honor of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttriumph. Cicero, whose desire for office was excited by this proposal, said\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the Senate that he understood that a negotiation was on foot among the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerals commanding the provinces, and he advised that they should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconciliate the man whom they had treated with disdain and who was still at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe head of a large army, and allow him to hold office in the city,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnotwithstanding his youth, rather than that he should remain under arms in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\thostile attitude. But lest he should do anything contrary to the interest of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Senate, Cicero proposed that some man of prudence from among the older\n\t\t\t\t\t\tones should be chosen as his colleague as a firm check upon the immaturity\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Octavius.

About the last watch\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe soldiers armed themselves as if for the march, seized the fortified\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparts of the camp, and opened the gates to Antony.

Lepidus leaped out of bed among them undressed, just as he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas, promised to do what they asked, embraced Antony, and pleaded necessity\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas his excuse.

He had the army with which he had abandoned the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsiege of Mutina, including its magnificent cavalry. Ventidius had joined him\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton the road with three legions. Lepidus had become his ally with seven\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegions of foot soldiers and a great number of auxiliary troops and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapparatus in proportion.

Having delivered this charge to the legates it forwarded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone-half of the donative and appointed ten men to divide it, to whom it did\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot add Octavius as the eleventh. As the two legions refused to meet them\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout Octavius, the legates returned leaving the business unfinished.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius no longer held communication with the troops through the medium of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers and no longer asked them to wait, but assembled the army and came\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore them and related to them the indignities he had suffered from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSenate, and its purpose to destroy all the friends of Gaius Csar,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone by one.

Thus their fears were greatly augmented. Cicero, who had so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlong taken the lead, was nowhere to be seen."}, "There was a sudden change on all hands. Instead of 2500 drachmas 5000 were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgiven. Instead of two legions only, the entire eight were to be paid.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius was appointed to make the distribution instead of the ten\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommissioners, and he was allowed to be a candidate for the consulship while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabsent.

They recounted the high spirit and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tendurance in behalf of freedom of the Romans of old, who never yielded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanything prejudicial to their liberty.", "As the two legions sent for from Africa happened to arrive in the harbor on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe same day, it seemed as though the gods were urging them to defend their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfreedom. Their regret for what they had done was confirmed; Cicero again\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmade his appearance, and they repealed all of the decrees above mentioned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAll who were of military age were called to arms, also the two legions from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfrica, and 1000 horse with them, and another legion that Pansa had left\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbehind, all these were assigned to their proper places. Some of them guarded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe so-called hill of Janiculum, where the money was stored, others held the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbridge over the Tiber, and the city prtors were put in command of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe separate divisions. Others made ready small boats and ships in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tharbor, together with money, in order to escape by sea in case they should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe vanquished. While courageously making these hasty preparations they hoped\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto alarm Octavius in his turn, and induce him to seek the consulship from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem instead of the army, or they hoped at least to defend themselves to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlast extremity. They hoped also to change those of the opposite faction as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoon as it became a contest for liberty. When they sought for the mother and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsister of Octavius, and did not discover them either in any open or secret\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabode, they were again alarmed at finding themselves deprived of such\n\t\t\t\t\t\timportant hostages, and as the Csarians showed no disposition to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyield to them they concluded that these women had been carefully concealed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby them.", "While Octavius was still giving audience to the messengers, it was announced\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto him that the decrees had been rescinded. The messengers thereupon\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithdrew, covered with confusion. With his army still more exasperated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius hastened to the city, fearing lest some evil should befall his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmother and sister. To the plebeians, who were in a state of consternation,\n\t\t\t\t\t\the sent horsemen in advance to tell them to have no fear.

Now another wonderful and sudden change took place.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPatricians flocked out and saluted him. The common people ran also and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadmired the good order of the soldiers, which they considered a sign of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeace.

Here, again,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcrowds met him along the whole road and saluted him, omitting nothing that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsavored of friendliness and weak compliance. His mother and sister, who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the temple of Vesta with the Vestal virgins, embraced him. The three\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlegions, in spite of their generals, sent ambassadors and transferred\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves to him. One of the generals in command of them, Cornutus, killed\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself. The others allied themselves with Octavius. When Cicero learned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis he sought an interview with Octavius through friends. When it was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgranted he defended himself and dwelt much upon his proposing Octavius for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe consulship, as he had done in the Senate on a former occasion. Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanswered ironically that Cicero seemed to be the last of his friends to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgreet him.", "The next night a rumor gained currency that two of Octavius' legions, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMartian and the Fourth, had gone over to the side of the republic, because\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey had been led against their country by deception. The prtors\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the Senate put faith in this report heedlessly, although the army was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery near, thinking that with the assistance of these two legions, as they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere the bravest, it would be possible to hold out against the rest of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius' army until some force from elsewhere should come to the rescue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe same night they sent Manius Aquilius Crassus to Picenum to raise troops,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand ordered one of the tribunes, named Apuleius, to run through the city and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproclaim the good news to the people.

The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother six were new levies, still untrained and unaccustomed to their labors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs he despaired of fighting, he decided to flee to Marcus Brutus in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMacedonia. He retreated not by the higher Alps, but toward Ravenna and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAquileia. Since Csar had travelled by this route, Decimus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproposed another longer and more difficult one -- to cross the Rhine and\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttraverse the wild country of barbarian tribes. Thereupon the new levies,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbewildered and fatigued, were the first to desert him and join Octavius.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter them the four older legions joined Antony, and the auxiliaries did the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame, except a body-guard of Gallic horse. Then Decimus allowed those who\n\t\t\t\t\t\twished to do so to return to their own homes, and, after distributing among\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem the gold he had with him, proceeded toward the Rhine with 300\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowers, the only ones who remained. As it was difficult to cross the\n\t\t\t\t\t\triver with so few, he was now abandoned by all the others except ten. He put\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton Gallic clothing, and, as he was acquainted with the language, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproceeded on his journey with these, passing himself off as a Gaul. He no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlonger followed the longer route, but went toward Aquileia, thinking that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould escape notice by reason of the smallness of his force."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "HW", "@place": "foot", "#text": "Velleius (ii. 64) gives a somewhat\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferent account of the death of Decimus. \"Decimus Brutus,\" he says,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"deserted first by Plancus and afterwards plotted against by him, seeing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\this army melting away, took to flight and accepted the hospitality of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnobleman named Camelus, in whose house he was found by Antony's\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\temissaries and slain.\" The Epitome of Livy (cxx.) says that Decimus was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tput to death by Capenas Sequanus by order of Antony, into whose hands he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad fallen."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "HW", "@place": "foot", "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "th=s palaia=s\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t*keltikh=s;"}, "infra,", "supra,", {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "perai/as"}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "palaia=s."}], "#text": "\"older Gaul,\" which, as Appian himself tells\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tus in iv. 2,  means that part of Transalpine\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGaul which was held by the Romans before Csar's conquests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYet we know from ii.

It is hardly probable that those who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvoted Dolabella an enemy for his most righteous deed could spare me, who\n\t\t\t\t\t\thold the same sentiments with him.

Finally, the sum and substance of my decision is this, I can bear\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe injuries that my friends have done me if they are willing to forget that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey have done them, or if they are ready to join me in avenging\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar's death.

Now, seeing that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmalice of those, who have conspired against us and from whom Gaius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar suffered, cannot be overcome by kindness, we prefer to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanticipate our enemies rather than suffer at their hands.

Some offered themselves to the murderers or sent for them when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey delayed.

Other like events had taken place\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the time of Sulla and even before him in that of Gaius Marius. The most\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnotable of these calamities I have narrated in my history of those times, in\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was the added horror that the dead were cast away unburied. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmatters we are now considering are the more remarkable by reason of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdignity of the triumvirs and especially of one of them, who, by means of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcharacter and good fortune, established the government on a firm foundation,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand left his lineage and name to those who now rule after him.

Then Cassius again sent to those who had\n\t\t\t\t\t\trejected his application, and also to Cleopatra, queen of Egypt, and to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSerapio, her viceroy in Cyprus. The Tyrians, the Aradii, and Serapio,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout consulting Cleopatra, sent Cassius what ships they had. The queen\n\t\t\t\t\t\texcused herself on the ground that Egypt was at that time suffering from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfamine and pestilence, but she was really cooperating with Dolabella on\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccount of her relations with the elder Csar. This was the reason\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhy she had sent him the four legions by Allienus, and had another fleet\n\t\t\t\t\t\tready to assist him, which was kept back by adverse winds. The Rhodians and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Lycians said that they would help neither Cassius nor Brutus in civil\n\t\t\t\t\t\twars, and that when they supplied ships to Dolabella they furnished them as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan escort, not knowing that they were to be used as allies in war.", "When Cassius was again ready with the forces in hand he engaged Dolabella a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecond time. The first battle was doubtful, but in the next one Dolabella\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas beaten on the sea. Then Cassius completed his mound and battered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDolabella's walls till they trembled. He tried unsuccessfully to corrupt\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarsus, the captain of the night-watch, but he bribed the centurions of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tday force and, while Marsus was taking his rest, effected an entrance by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdaylight through a number of small gates that were secretly opened to him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tone after another.

The guard cut it off, but he killed himself also,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Marsus took his own life. Cassius swore Dolabella's army into his own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservice. He plundered the temples and the treasury of Laodicea, punished the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchief citizens, and exacted very heavy contributions from the rest, so that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe city was reduced to the extremest misery.", "After the capture of Laodicea Cassius turned his attention to Egypt.

This force arrived after the decisive battle, ravaged Syria\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand many of the neighboring provinces as far as Ionia, and then returned\n\t\t\t\t\t\thome.

The more prudent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRhodians were still more alarmed, but the multitude were excited by two\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic speakers named Alexander and Mnaseas, who reminded them that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMithridates had invaded Rhodes with a still larger fleet, and that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDemetrius had done so before him; whereupon they elected Alexander as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprytanis, who is the magistrate exercising the supreme power among them, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMnaseas as admiral of their fleet."}, "Nevertheless, they sent still another ambassador to Cassius in the person of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tArchelaus, who had been his teacher in Greek literature in Rhodes, to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpresent a more earnest petition. This he did, taking Cassius by the right\n\t\t\t\t\t\thand in a familiar manner, and saying, \"O friend of the Greeks, do not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsubvert a Greek city. O friend of freedom, do not attack Rhodes. Do not put\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto shame the glory of a Doric state hitherto unvanquished. Do not forget the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfamous histories you learned both at Rhodes and at Rome -- at Rhodes, what\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Rhodians accomplished against states and kings (and especially against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDemetrius and Mithridates, who were deemed invincible), in behalf of that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfreedom for which you say that you also are now contending -- at Rome, our\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservices to you, among others those that were rendered when we fought with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou against Antiochus the Great, concerning which you have monuments\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinscribed in our honor. So much, O Roman, for our race, our dignity, our\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcondition hitherto unenslaved, our alliance, and our good-will toward you.", "\"As for you, Cassius, you owe a peculiar reverence to this city in which you\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere brought up and educated, restored to health when sick, where you had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour hearthstone, and where you attended my very school. You owe respect to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tme who have hoped that I should some time plume myself on your education\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith different hopes, but I am now pleading this relation in behalf of my\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry, lest it be forced into a war with you, its pupil and its ward,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhere one of two things must necessarily happen: either that the Rhodians\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperish utterly, or Cassius be defeated. In addition to my entreaty I give\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou the advice that while engaged in such important tasks in behalf of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRoman commonwealth you take the gods for your leaders at every step. You,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans, swore by the gods when you recently concluded the treaty with us\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough Gaius Csar, and to the oaths you added libations and gave\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe right hand, which is valid even among enemies, not to mention friends\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand wards. Besides dreading the judgment of the gods, have regard for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\topinions of mankind, who consider nothing more base than a violation of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttreaties, which causes the violators to be distrusted in all respects by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboth friends and enemies.\"", "When the old man had thus spoken he did not let go Cassius' hand, but shed\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttears on it, so that Cassius blushed at the spectacle and was moved somewhat\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the sense of shame, yet he drew away his hand, and said, \"If you have not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcounselled the Rhodians not to wrong me, you have yourself done me wrong. If\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou have so counselled them and they have not followed your advice I will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tavenge you. That I have suffered injury is plain enough. The first wrong\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdone me was when I asked assistance and was slighted by my guardians and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstructors. In the next place they gave the preference to Dolabella, whom\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey had not brought up and educated, rather than to me. And what makes it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworse, O freedom-loving Rhodians, is that Brutus and I and the noblest men\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Senate, whom you see here, were fugitives from tyranny for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tendeavoring to liberate their country, while Dolabella was seeking to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenslave it to others, whom you also favor while pretending to abstain from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour civil wars. This would be a civil war if we also were aiming at supreme\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpower, but it is plainly a war of the republic against monarchy. And you,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho appeal to me in behalf of your own freedom, have refused aid to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trepublic. While professing friendship for the Romans you have no pity for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose who have been sentenced to death and confiscation without trial. You\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpretend that you want to hear from the Senate, which is suffering from these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery evils and is not yet able to defend itself. But the Senate had answered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou beforehand when it decreed that all the peoples of the Orient should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlend aid to Brutus and myself.", "\"Whatever aid you have rendered us when we were adding to our possessions\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(for which you reaped an abundant reward) you remind us of, but when in our\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime of adversity you fail us in the struggle for freedom and safety, you\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave very short memories. Even if we had had no relations with each other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore, you ought, as members of the Doric race, to be willing to begin now\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto fight for the Roman republic. Instead of such thoughts and deeds you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquote to us treaties, -- treaties made with you by Gaius Csar,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe founder of the present monarchy, -- yet these very treaties say that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans and the Rhodians shall assist each other in case of need. Therefore,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassist the Romans in the time of their greatest peril! It is Cassius who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquotes these very treaties to you and calls for your help in war, --\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCassius, a Roman citizen and a Roman general, whom, as the Senate's decree\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsays, all the countries beyond the Adriatic are required to obey. The same\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdecrees are presented to you by Brutus, and also by Pompeius, who has been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinvested by the Senate with the command of the sea. Added to these decrees\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare the prayers of all these senators who have fled, some to myself and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus, and others to Pompeius. The treaty provides that the Rhodians shall\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlend aid to the Romans even in cases where the application is made by single\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindividuals. If you do not consider us as generals or even as Romans, but as\n\t\t\t\t\t\texiles, or strangers, or persons condemned, as the proscribers call us, O\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRhodians, you have no treaties with us, but only with the Roman people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBeing strangers and foreigners to the treaties, we will fight you till you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobey our orders in everything.\" With this ironical remark Cassius sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tArchelaus away.", "Alexander and Mnaseas, the Rhodian leaders, put to sea with their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthirty-three ships against Cassius at Myndus, intending to surprise him by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe suddenness of their attack. They built their hopes somewhat lightly on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe supposition that by sailing against Mithridates at Myndus they had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrought that war to a successful end. In order to display their seamanship\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey took their station the first day at Cnidus. The next day they showed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves to the forces of Cassius on the high sea. The latter in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tastonishment put to sea against them, and it was a battle of strength and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tskill on both sides. The Rhodians with their light ships darted swiftly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough the enemy's line, turned around, and attacked them in the rear. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans had heavier ships, and whenever they could come to close quarters\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey prevailed, as in an engagement on land, by their greater strength.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCassius, by reason of his more numerous fleet, was enabled to surround his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy, and then the latter could no longer turn and dart through his line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen they could only attack in front and then haul off, their nautical skill\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas of no avail in the narrow space where they were confined. The ramming\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith their prows and broadside movements against the heavier Roman ships did\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle damage, while those of the Romans against the lighter vessels were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore effective. Finally, three Rhodian ships were captured with their crews,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo were rammed and sunk, and the remainder took flight to Rhodes in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdamaged condition.

When he had repaired his ships he sailed to Loryma, a fortified\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplace belonging to the Rhodians on the mainland opposite the island, from\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich he sent his foot-soldiers across in transports under the command of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFannius and Lentulus. He advanced in person with eighty ships rigged in a way to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproduce terror. He surrounded Rhodes with his land and naval forces, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthen remained quiet, expecting that the enemy would show signs of weakening.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut they sailed out again valiantly and, after losing two more ships, were\n\t\t\t\t\t\themmed in on all sides.

Thus was Rhodes, after suffering two naval\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefeats, beleaguered by land and sea, and, as frequently happens in sudden\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand unexpected trouble, found herself wholly unprepared for siege; whence it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecame evident that the city must speedily be taken either by assault or by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfamine.

They hurled missiles at the messengers,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand, after destroying their own families, placed the bodies on funeral\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpiles, which they had previously erected in their houses, set fire to them,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand slew themselves on the same. Brutus saved such of the temples as he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould, but he captured only the slaves of the Xanthians; and of the citizens\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta few free women and hardly 150 men. Thus the Xanthians perished the third\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime by their own hands on account of their love of liberty; for when the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity was besieged by Harpagus, the Mede, the general of Cyrus the Great,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey destroyed themselves in like manner rather than be enslaved, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity, shut up by Harpagus, then became the tomb of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Xanthians; and it is said that they suffered a similar fate at the hands\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Alexander, the son of Philip, as they would not submit to obey him even\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter he had become the master of so large a portion of the earth."}, "Brutus went from Xanthus down to Patara, a city which was something like a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseaport of the Xanthians. He surrounded it with his army and ordered the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinhabitants to obey him in everything, under penalty of meeting the fate of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Xanthians. Certain Xanthians were brought to them who lamented their own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmisfortunes and advised them to adopt wiser counsels. As the inhabitants of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPatara made no sort of answer to the Xanthians, Brutus gave them the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremainder of the day to consider the matter, and went away. The next morning\n\t\t\t\t\t\the moved his troops forward. The Patarans cried out from the walls that they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould obey all his commands, and opened their gates. He came in, but he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneither killed nor banished anybody; but he ordered them to deliver to him\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhatever gold and silver the city possessed, and each citizen to bring in\n\t\t\t\t\t\this private holdings under the same penalties and rewards to informers as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose proclaimed by Cassius at Rhodes. They obeyed his order. One slave\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttestified that his master had concealed his gold, and showed it to a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcenturion who was sent to find it. All the parties were brought before the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttribunal. The master remained silent, but his mother, who had followed in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder to save her son, cried out that she had concealed the gold. The slave,\n\t\t\t\t\t\talthough not interrogated, disputed her, saying that she lied and that his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmaster had concealed it. Brutus approved of the young man's silence and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsympathized with his mother's grief. He allowed them both to depart unharmed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand to take their gold with them, and he crucified the slave for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuperserviceable zeal in accusing his superiors.", "At the same time Lentulus, who had been sent to Andriace, the seaport of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMyreans, broke the chain which closed the harbor and ascended to Myra. As\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe inhabitants obeyed his commands, he collected money in the same way as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat Patara and returned to Brutus. The confederation of Lycia sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tambassadors to Brutus promising to form a military league with him and to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontribute what money they could. He imposed taxes on them and he restored\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe free Xanthians to their city. He ordered the Lycian fleet, together with\n\t\t\t\t\t\this own ships, to set sail for Abydus, where he would rendezvous with his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tland forces and await Cassius, who was coming from Ionia, so that they might\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcross over to Sestus together. When Murcus, who was at Peloponnesus lying in\n\t\t\t\t\t\twait for Cleopatra, learned that her fleet had been damaged by a storm on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Libyan coast, and saw the wreckage borne by the waves as far as Laconia,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand knew that she had returned home with difficulty and in ill health, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsailed for Brundusium in order that he might not be idle with so great a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfleet. He came to anchor at the island lying opposite the harbor, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevented the remainder of the enemy's army and supplies from passing over\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Macedonia. Antony fought him with the few war-ships that he had, and with\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttowers mounted on floats, whenever he sent out detachments of his army on\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttransports and was favored by a strong wind from the land, in order that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey might not be captured by Murcus.

He roamed about the ocean with a few followers, committing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpiracy and concealing the fact that he was Pompeius. When larger numbers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjoined him for the purpose of pillage, and his force became powerful, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevealed his name. Presently those who had served with his father and his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrother, and who were leading a vagabond life, drifted to him as their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnatural leader, and Arabio, who had been deprived of his ancestral kingdom,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas I have related previously, came to him from Africa. His forces being thus\n\t\t\t\t\t\taugmented, his doings were now more important than robbery, and as he flew\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom place to place the name of Pompeius spread through the whole of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpain, which was the most extensive of the provinces; but\n\t\t\t\t\t\the avoided coming to an engagement with the governors of it appointed by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGaius Csar. When Csar learned of his doings he sent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCarinas with a stronger army to fight him. Pompeius, however, being the more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnimble of the two, would show himself and then disappear, and so he wore out\n\t\t\t\t\t\this enemy and got possession of a number of towns, large and small."}, "Then Csar sent Asinius Pollio as successor to Carinas to prosecute\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe war against Pompeius. While they were carrying on the same kind of\n\t\t\t\t\t\twarfare, Csar was assassinated and the Senate recalled Pompeius.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe latter came to Massilia and there watched the course of events at Rome.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHaving been appointed commander of the sea with the same powers that his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfather had exercised, he did not yet come back to the city, but, taking what\n\t\t\t\t\t\tships he found in the harbors, and joining them with those he had brought\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Spain, he put to sea. When the triumvirate was established he sailed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSicily, and as Bithynicus, the governor, would not yield the island, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbesieged him, until Hirtius and Fannius, two men who had been proscribed and\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad fled from Rome, persuaded Bithynicus to surrender Sicily to Pompeius.", "In this way Pompeius possessed himself of Sicily, and thus had ships, and an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tisland lying convenient to Italy, and an army, now of considerable size,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomposed of those whom he had before, and those who had fled from Rome, both\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfreemen and slaves, or those sent to him by the Italian cities which had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen proclaimed as prizes of victory for the soldiers. These cities dreaded\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta victory of the triumvirs more than anything else, and whatever they could\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo against them secretly they did. The wealthy citizens fled from a country\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat they could no longer consider their own and took refuge with Pompeius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho was near by and greatly beloved by all at that time. There were present\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith him also many seafaring men from Africa and Spain, skilled in naval\n\t\t\t\t\t\taffairs, so that Pompeius was well provided with officers, ships, troops,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand money. When Octavius learned these facts he sent Salvidienus with a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfleet to come alongside of Pompeius and destroy him, as though it were an\n\t\t\t\t\t\teasy task, while he passed through Italy himself with the intention of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjoining Salvidienus at Rhegium. Pompeius advanced with a large fleet to meet\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSalvidienus, and a naval engagement took place between them at the entrance\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the straits near the promontory of Scyllum. The ships of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius, being lighter and manned by better sailors, excelled in swiftness\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand skill, while those of the Romans, being of great tonnage and size,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabored heavily. When the usual rush of waves through the straits came on,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the sea dashed hither and thither under the influence of the current,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ships of Pompeius suffered less than their adversaries, because they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere accustomed to the agitation of the waters; while those of Salvidienus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing unable to maintain their position firmly, or to work their oars, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanage their rudders, by reason of their inexperience, were thrown into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconfusion. Accordingly, about sunset, Salvidienus was the first to give the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsignal of retreat. Pompeius withdrew also. The ships suffered about equally\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton both sides.

There was no longer\n\t\t\t\t\t\tany law supreme, either aristocratic or plebeian, nor any of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinstitutions that our fathers established when they expelled the kings and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tswore never to tolerate royal government again. We, descendants of the men\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho thus swore, sustained that oath and warded off the curse from ourselves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe could no longer endure that one man, although he was our friend and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbenefactor, should take from the people and vest in himself the control of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe public money, the armies, and the elections, and from the Senate the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappointment of governors of the provinces; that his will should take the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplace of the laws, his rule should supplant that of the people, and his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupremacy that of the Senate in everything.", "\"Perhaps you did not understand these matters particularly, but saw only his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbravery in war. Yet you may easily learn about them now by observing only\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe part that concerns yourselves. You, of the common people, when you go to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe wars, obey your generals as masters in everything. But in time of peace\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou resume the mastery over us. The Senate deliberates first, in order that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou may not make a slip, but you decide for yourselves; you give your votes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby tribes, or by centuries; you choose the consuls, the tribunes, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprtors. In the comitia you pass judgment on the weightiest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquestions, and you decide rewards and punishments when we have deserved\n\t\t\t\t\t\trewards or punishments at your hands. This balance of powers, O citizens,\n\t\t\t\t\t\thas raised the empire to the summit of fortune and conferred honors upon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose worthy of them, and the men thus honored have returned thanks to you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy virtue of this power you made Scipio consul when you bore testimony to\n\t\t\t\t\t\this deeds in Africa, and you elected whom you pleased each year as tribunes,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto oppose us in your interest if necessary. But why should I repeat so many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthings that you already know?", "\"From the time when Csar's domination began you no longer elected\n\t\t\t\t\t\tany magistrate, either prtor, or consul, or tribune. Nor did you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbear testimony to anybody's deeds, nor, if you had done so, could you have\n\t\t\t\t\t\trewarded them. In a word, nobody owed you any thanks either for a magistracy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor a governorship, either for approving his accounts or acquitting him on a\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrial. Most lamentable of all, you could not defend your tribunes against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinsult, whom you had constituted your own peculiar and perpetual magistracy,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand had made sacred and inviolable. Yet you saw these inviolable men\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdespoiled with contumely of this inviolable office, and of their sacred\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvestments, without trial, at the order of one man, because in your behalf\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey saw fit to proceed against certain persons who wished to proclaim him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas king. The senators were deeply grieved at this on your account, for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffice of tribune is yours, not theirs. But they were not able to censure\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis man openly or to bring him to trial by reason of the strength of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmies, which, although heretofore belonging to the republic, he had made\n\t\t\t\t\t\this own. So they adopted the only remaining method to ward off tyranny, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat was to conspire against the person of the tyrant.", "\"It was necessary that the decision should be that of the best men, but that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe deed should be done by a few. When it was done the Senate voiced the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgeneral approval clearly by proposing rewards to the tyrannicides. Antony\n\t\t\t\t\t\trestrained them from doing so on the pretext that it would lead to disorder;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnor was it our intention to confer this benefit upon Rome for the sake of\n\t\t\t\t\t\treward, but solely for the sake of the country. Accordingly the senators\n\t\t\t\t\t\trefrained, not wishing to insult Csar, but only to get rid of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttyranny. So they voted amnesty for all, and it was more particularly decreed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat there should be no prosecution for the murder. After a little, when\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony excited the mob against us, the Senate gave us command of the largest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovinces and armies, and ordered all the countries between Syria and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAdriatic to obey us. In so doing did they punish us as monsters, or did they\n\t\t\t\t\t\trather distinguish us as tyrannicides with the royal purple and with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trods and axes? For like reason the Senate recalled from exile the younger\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius (who was not concerned in this conspiracy), because he was the only\n\t\t\t\t\t\tson of Pompey the Great, who first took up arms to defend the republic, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause the young man had made some little opposition in a private way to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe tyranny in Spain. It passed a decree also to pay back to him, out of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic funds, the value of his father's property, and it appointed him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadmiral in order that he also might hold a command because he was on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tside of the republic. What more could you ask of the Senate by way of deed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor of sign to show that everything was done with their approval, unless that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey should declare it to you in so many words? But they will do and say\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis very thing, and saying it they will repay you with magnificent gifts,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen they are able to speak and to requite your services.", "\"What their present situation is you know. They have been proscribed without\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrial, and their property confiscated. Without being condemned, they have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen put to death in their houses, in the streets, in temples, by soldiers,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby slaves, by personal enemies. They have been dragged out of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\thiding-places and pursued everywhere, although the laws allow anybody to go\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto voluntary exile. In the forum, where the head of an enemy was never\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcarried, but only captured arms and the beaks of ships, the heads of those\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho were lately consuls, prtors, tribunes, diles, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknights have been exhibited. Rewards have been assigned for these horrors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is a breaking out of all the wounds that had been previously healed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tover, -- sudden seizures of men, and all kinds of infamy perpetrated by\n\t\t\t\t\t\twives and sons, freedmen and slaves. Into so desperate a plight and such\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconditions has the city now been plunged. At the head of all these villains\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare the triumvirs, who proscribe their own brothers and uncles and tutors\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst of all. It is said that the city was once captured by the most savage\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbarbarians, but the Gauls never cut off any heads, they never insulted the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdead, they never begrudged their enemies a chance to hide or fly. Nor did we\n\t\t\t\t\t\tever treat in this way any city that we had captured in war, nor did we ever\n\t\t\t\t\t\thear of others doing so. Moreover, it is no ordinary city, but the mistress\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the world, that is thus wronged by those who have been chosen to set in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder and regulate the republic. What did Tarquin ever do like this, --\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTarquin, whom our ancestors hurled from the throne for an outrage committed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupon one woman under the influence of the amatory passion, and then, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat one act, they resolved to be ruled by kings no longer?", "\"While the triumvirs are committing these outrages, O citizens, they call us\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinfamous wretches. They say they are avenging Csar when they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproscribe men who were not in Rome when he was killed. Very many of these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare here, as you see, who have been proscribed on account of their wealth,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir family, or their preferences for republican government. For this\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason Pompeius was proscribed with us, although he was far away in Spain\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen we did the deed. Because he was the son of a republican father (for\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich reason also he was recalled by the Senate and made commander of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsea), he was proscribed by the triumvirs. What part have those women had in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe conspiracy against Csar, who have been condemned to pay\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttribute? What part have those plebeians had, whose property is worth 100,000\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrachmas each, upon whom new taxes and contributions have been imposed,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich they have been ordered to pay under penalty of being informed against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand fined? And even while levying these exactions the triumvirs have not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfully paid the sums promised to their troops, while we, who have done\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnothing contrary to justice, have given you all that we promised and have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother funds ready for still larger rewards. So it comes about that the gods\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfavor us because we do what is just.", "\"Besides the favor of the gods you can see that we have that of mankind by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlooking at these, your fellow-citizens, whom you have often beheld as your\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgenerals and your consuls, and who have won your praises as such. You see\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat they have had recourse to us as to men doing right and defending the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trepublic. They espouse our cause, they offer up their prayers, and they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcoperate with us for what still remains to be done. Far more just\n\t\t\t\t\t\tare the rewards we have offered to those who rescue them than those which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe triumvirs offer for killing them. The triumvirs know that we, who killed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar because he assumed the monarchy, would not tolerate them in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassuming his power and that we would not assume it ourselves, but that we\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould restore to the people in common the government as we received it from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour ancestors. So you see the two sides have not taken up arms for the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason, -- the enemy aiming at monarchy and despotism, as their proscription\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready proves, while we seek nothing but the mere privilege of living as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprivate citizens under the laws of our country made once more free.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNaturally the men before you espouse our side as the gods had done\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreviously.

So the Chalcideans and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother Greeks took possession of it, being seafaring people, and caused it to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflourish with commerce and agriculture, and the Thracians were much\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgratified by the opportunity for the exchange of products.

As soon as the latter pass was abandoned Brutus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Cassius marched through it.", "When the stratagem became manifest Norbanus and Decidius occupied the gorge\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Sapans strongly. Again Brutus and Cassius could find no\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpassage. They fell into discouragement lest they should now have to begin\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe roundabout journey which they had disdained, and to turn upon their own\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttracks, although pressed by time and the lateness of the season. While they\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere in this mood Rhascupolis said that there was a circuitous route (along\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe very side of the Sapan mountain) of three days' march, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been impassable to men up to this time on account of rocks, scarcity of\n\t\t\t\t\t\twater, and dense forests. If they would carry their water and make a narrow\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut sufficient pathway, they would be so enveloped in shade that they would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot be perceived even by birds. On the fourth day they would come to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\triver Harpessus, which falls into the Hebrus, and in one day more they would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe at Philippi, flanking the enemy so as to cut him off completely and leave\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim no chance to retreat. They adopted this plan since there was nothing\n\t\t\t\t\t\telse to do, and especially because it held out the hope of surrounding so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge a force of the enemy.", "They sent a detachment in advance under command of Lucius Bibulus, in company\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Rhascupolis, to cut a path. They found it a very laborious task, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey accomplished it nevertheless with enthusiastic zeal, and all the more\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen some who had gone ahead came back and said that they had had a distant\n\t\t\t\t\t\tview of the river. On the fourth day, fatigued with labor and thirst, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twater which they carried being nearly exhausted, they recollected that it\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad been said that they should be in a waterless region only three days. So\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey fell into a panic, fearing that they were the victims of a stratagem.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey did not disbelieve those who had been sent in advance and who said that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey had seen the river, but they thought that they themselves had been led\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin a different direction. They lost heart and cried aloud, and when they saw\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRhascupolis riding by and exhorting them to have courage, they reviled him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand threw stones at him. While Bibulus was beseeching them with words of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgood cheer to persevere to the end, towards evening the river was seen by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose in front, who, as was natural, raised a cry of joy, which was taken up\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby those behind in due order until it reached the rear. When Brutus and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCassius learned this they hurried forward at once, leading on the remainder\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof their army through the pathway that had been cleared.

Cassius was amazed at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tingenuity as well as the secrecy of this work, and he formed the counter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdesign of cutting Antony off from his redoubts. He carried a transverse wall\n\t\t\t\t\t\tacross the whole marsh from his camp to the sea, cutting and bridging in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame manner as Antony had done, and laying a solid foundation for his\n\t\t\t\t\t\trampart, thus intercepting the passage sage made by Antony, so that those\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinside could not escape to him, nor he render assistance to them.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "HW", "@place": "foot", "foreign": [{"@lang": "greek", "#text": "w(s au)to\\s e)n toi=s\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tu(pomnh/masin e)/grayen."}, {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "i(storei="}, "relates", {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "e)/grayen"}, "has written"], "title": "Life of Brutus,", "#text": "Plutarch used the same words with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta single variation, substituting  () for  ().\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis identity of language would indicate that they drew from the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsource, yet their accounts of the beginning of the battle differ from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teach other.

Vessels half burned\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfloated a long time, containing men perishing by fire, by hunger, and by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthirst.

He preferred to endure a siege, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanything else, rather than come to an engagement with men who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfamishing, and whose hopes rested solely on fighting because they despaired\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof every other resource. His soldiers, however, without reflection,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tentertained a different opinion. They took it hard that they should be shut\n\t\t\t\t\t\tup, idle and cowardly, like women, within their fortifications. Their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tofficers, although they approved of Brutus' design, were vexed, thinking\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat in the present temper of the army they might overpower the enemy more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tquickly. Brutus himself was the cause of these murmurs, being of a gentle\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand kindly disposition toward all -- not like Cassius, who was austere and\n\t\t\t\t\t\timperious in every way, for which reason the army obeyed his orders\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpromptly, not interfering with his authority, not inquiring the reasons for\n\t\t\t\t\t\this orders, and not criticising them when they had learned them. But in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase of Brutus they expected nothing else than to share the command with him\n\t\t\t\t\t\ton account of his mildness of temper. Finally, the soldiers began openly to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollect together in companies and groups and to ask each other, \"Why does\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour general put a stigma upon us? How have we offended lately -- we who\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconquered the enemy and put him to flight; we who slaughtered those opposed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto us and took their camp?\" Brutus took no notice of these murmurs, nor did\n\t\t\t\t\t\the call an assembly, lest he should be forced from his position, contrary to\n\t\t\t\t\t\this dignity, by the unreasoning multitude, and especially by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmercenaries, who, like fickle slaves seeking new masters, always rest their\n\t\t\t\t\t\thopes of safety on desertion to the enemy.", "His officers kept teasing and urging him to make use of the eagerness of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy now, which would speedily bring glorious results. If the battle should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tturn out adversely, they could fall back to their walls and put the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfortifications between themselves and the enemy. Brutus was especially vexed\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith these, for they were his officers, and he grieved that they, who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\texposed to the same peril as himself, should capriciously side with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers in preferring a quick and doubtful chance to a victory without\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdanger; but, to the ruin of himself and them, he yielded, chiding them with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese words, \"I seem to be carrying on war like Pompey the Great, not so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch commanding as commanded.\" I think that Brutus restricted himself to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese words in order to conceal his greatest fear, lest those of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers who had formerly served under Csar should become\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisaffected and desert to the enemy.

On the one side it\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas a fight for self-preservation rather than victory; on the other for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvictory and for the satisfaction of the general who had been forced to fight\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst his will. The slaughter and the groans were terrible. The bodies of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fallen were carried back and others stepped into their places from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trear ranks. The generals flew hither and thither overlooking everything,\n\t\t\t\t\t\texciting the men by their ardor, exhorting the toilers to toil on, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelieving those who were exhausted so that there was always fresh courage at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe front. Finally, the soldiers of Octavius, either from fear of famine, or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby the good fortune of Octavius himself (for the soldiers of Brutus were not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tblameworthy), pushed back the enemy's line as though they were putting in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmotion a very heavy machine.

The soldiers of Octavius, then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially mindful of the order they had received, seized the gates of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy's fortification, but at great risk to themselves because they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\texposed to missiles from above and in front, but they prevented a great many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the enemy from gaining entrance.

These divided their work; some of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem hurried up the mountain with Rhascus, the Thracian, who was sent with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem on account of his knowledge of the roads.

Lucilius seeing them rushing on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfuriously, surrendered himself, pretending to be Brutus, and asked them to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake him to Antony instead of Octavius; for which reason chiefly he was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbelieved to be Brutus trying to avoid his implacable enemy.

Portia, the wife of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBrutus and sister of the younger Cato, when she learned that both had died\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the manner described, although very strictly watched by domestics, seized\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome coals of fire that they were carrying, and swallowed them. Of the members of the nobility who escaped to Thasos some\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttook ship from thence, others committed themselves with the remains of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy to the judgment of Messala Corvinus and Lucius Bibulus, men of equal\n\t\t\t\t\t\trank, to do for all what they should decide to do for themselves.

These soldiers were not enlisted from the ordinary\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconscription, but were picked men.

Speaking the same language and using the same tactics, being of like\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscipline and power of endurance, they were for these reasons evenly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmatched.

He fled first to his Tusculan villa and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthence proceeded by cross-roads to that of Formi in order to take\n\t\t\t\t\t\tship at Caieta.

So he returned to his upper villa,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was a little more than a mile from the shore, saying, 'I will die in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmy fatherland that I have so often saved.'

When they heard of the proscription they decided to go\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdown to Astura, Cicero's place on the sea-coast, and sail thence to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMacedonia to join Brutus, for it was already rumored that he had mastered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose parts. They were conveyed, sorrow-stricken, in litters, and often\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstopped on the road, bringing their litters near together, and condoled with\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach other. Quintus was particularly disturbed as he remembered his needy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcondition. So he said that, as he had brought nothing from home, and as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCicero's provision was also very scanty, it would be best for the latter to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinue his flight, while Quintus should return home and provide himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith necessaries. After this was decided upon they embraced each other,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twept, and went different ways. Quintus, not many days later, was betrayed by\n\t\t\t\t\t\this servants to the pursuers, and was killed, together with his son. Cicero\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas conveyed to Astura, where he found a ship ready, in which he embarked\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand sailed as far as Circum with a favorable wind. The pilots\n\t\t\t\t\t\twished to proceed from that place immediately, but Cicero, either fearing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe sea, or not having lost all faith in Octavius, went ashore and travelled\n\t\t\t\t\t\t100 stades by land toward Rome. Again he became anxious, changed his mind,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand went back to the sea-shore at Astura. There he passed the night in great\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrouble and perplexity. He even contemplated going secretly to the house of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius and killing himself on his hearthstone, in order to bring divine\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvengeance upon him, but the fear of torture changed his purpose. Then,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfalling a prey to other perplexed and varying counsels, he allowed his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tservants to convey him by sea to Caieta, where he had a country place, an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagreeable retreat in the summer season when the north winds blow fresh.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere was a small temple on the sea-shore at this place, out of which crows\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflew in large numbers and with loud noise, to Cicero's ship as it neared the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tland, and, alighting on either side of the yard-arm, some of them croaked\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand others pecked at the ends of the ropes. This seemed to all to be an ill\n\t\t\t\t\t\tomen. Nevertheless, Cicero disembarked and proceeded to his villa, where he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twent to bed to take a little rest.

When the servants saw this they reproached themselves\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor remaining idle spectators of their master's fate, and not rescuing him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin his undeserved distress, while the brute creation was lending him aid.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo, partly by entreaty, partly by force, they put him in the litter and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcarried him toward the sea-shore.", {"title": "Life of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCicero,", "#text": "\"In the meantime the murderers were coming, under the command of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcenturion Herennius and the military tribune Popilius, whom Cicero had once\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefended when he was prosecuted for killing his own father.

These\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolonies were well affected toward Antony. Barbatius, a qustor of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony, who had had some difficulty with him and was returning home for that\n\t\t\t\t\t\treason, said, in answer to inquiries, that Antony was displeased with those\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho were making war on Octavius to the prejudice of their common sway;\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhereupon some, who were not aware of the deception practised by Barbatius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanged sides from Lucius to Octavius.

Then the troops of Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjoyfully clashed their arms as for a victory, whereupon those of Lucius were\n\t\t\t\t\t\troused to anger and again seized their ladders (although they had no more\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttowers), and carried them to the walls with desperation. Yet they did not do\n\t\t\t\t\t\tany harm to the enemy, for they could not. Lucius ran among them and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbesought them to sacrifice their lives no longer, and led them back groaning\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand reluctant.", "This was the end of this hotly contested siege. In order that the enemy might\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot make another attempt on his works, Octavius stationed a part of his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmy, that was held in reserve, alongside the fortifications, and instructed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers in other places to leap upon the wall at the sound of the trumpet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough no one urged them on, they went through this exercise continually,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin order to become familiar with it, and to inspire the enemy with fear. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttroops of Lucius began to grow down-hearted, and, as usually happens in such\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcases, the guards relaxed their vigilance, and thus desertion became more\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrequent, not only of the common soldiers, but, in some cases, of the higher\n\t\t\t\t\t\tofficers also. And now Lucius inclined toward peace, out of pity for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperishing multitude, but the fears of some of the enemies of Octavius for\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir own safety still restrained him. But as Octavius was observed to treat\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe deserters kindly, and the desire for peace increased among all, Lucius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbegan to fear lest, if he refused, he should be delivered up."]}, {"@type": "chapter", "@n": "5", "@id": "b5c5", "head": "CHAPTER V", "argument": {"p": "Lucius addresses his Soldiers on the Subject of Surrender -- Sends Envoys\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto Octavius -- Makes a Personal Visit to Octavius -- What Lucius said to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\thim -- Lucius surrenders unconditionally -- Reply of Octavius -- The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSoldiers of the Two Armies embrace each other -- Octavius pardons Lucius\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand all except a Few Leaders -- Perusia destroyed by Fire"}, "milestone": [{"@n": "39", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "40", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "41", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "42", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "43", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "44", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "45", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "46", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "47", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "48", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "49", "@unit": "section"}], "p": [{"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "HW", "@place": "foot", "#text": "Ventidius, Asinius, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlancus."}, "#text": "Accordingly, having made a sort of test which gave him encouragement, Lucius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalled his army together and spoke as follows: \"It was my intention,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfellow-soldiers, to restore the republic to you when I saw that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgovernment of the triumvirs was a tyranny, which was established, indeed, on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe pretext of combating Brutus and Cassius, but was not relaxed after their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeath. Lepidus had been deprived of his share of the government, Antony was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfar away collecting money, and this one man was managing everything\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccording to his own will, and the ancient system of Roman government was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonly a pretence and a laughing-stock. With the intention of reverting to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfreedom and democratic government of our ancestors, I asked that after the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trewards of victory had been distributed the monarchy should be dissolved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen my request was not granted, I sought to enforce it by virtue of my\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffice. Octavius falsely accused me, before the army, of obstructing the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolonies out of pity for the landowners. I was ignorant of this slander for\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta long time, and even when I learned of it I did not suppose that anybody\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcould believe it, when one saw that the colony officers were men assigned by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmy very self to divide the lands among you. But the calumny misled some\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople, who joined Octavius in order to make war against us as they think.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut eventually they will find that they have been warring against their own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterests. I affirm that you have chosen the better cause, and that you have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuffered for it beyond your strength. We are vanquished, not by our enemies,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut by hunger, to which we have been left a prey by our own generals. It would be becoming in me to fight to the last\n\t\t\t\t\t\textremity for my country. Such an end would make my fame glorious after my\n\t\t\t\t\t\thigh purposes. To that destiny I do not submit, for the sake of you, whom I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprefer to my own fame. I will send to the conqueror and beg that he will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflict such punishment as he chooses upon me alone, in place of all of you;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he will grant amnesty, not to me, but to you, his fellow-citizens and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformerly his soldiers, who are not now in the wrong, who are not fighting\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout good cause, and are vanquished, not by war, but by hunger.\""}, "After speaking thus he at once selected three men from the optimates for this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmission. The multitude wept, some on their own account, some on account of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir general, who appeared to them to have been actuated by the most\n\t\t\t\t\t\texcellent and democratic purpose, and who now yielded to extreme necessity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe three envoys, when admitted to the presence of Octavius, reminded him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the soldiers on both sides were all of one race, and that they had made\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcampaigns together. They called to mind the friendship of the nobility on\n\t\t\t\t\t\teither side and also the virtue of their ancestors, who did not allow their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifferences to become irreconcilable. They advanced other like arguments\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich were calculated to prevail with him. Octavius, knowing that some of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe enemy were still raw recruits, while others were colonized veterans,\n\t\t\t\t\t\treplied artfully that he would grant amnesty to Antony's soldiers out of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregard for him, but that the others must surrender at discretion. This he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid in the presence of all, but, taking aside Furnius, one of the three, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tled him to expect mild treatment for Lucius and the rest, except his own\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersonal enemies.", "These personal enemies of Octavius, having learned of Furnius' private\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterview and suspecting that it related to themselves, reproached him when\n\t\t\t\t\t\the came back, and demanded of Lucius either that he should ask a new treaty,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich should include all alike, or fight to the death, saying that this had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot been a private war for any individual, but a public one in behalf of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountry. Lucius in pity commended them as men of the same rank as himself,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand said that he would send another embassy. Then he added that no one was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetter fitted for this task than himself, and went immediately without a\n\t\t\t\t\t\therald, merely preceded by some persons who went in advance to announce to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius his coming. The latter at once advanced to meet him. There they saw\n\t\t\t\t\t\teach other surrounded by their friends and distinguished by the standards\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand military equipment of generals on either side. Then Lucius, dismissing\n\t\t\t\t\t\this friends, went forward with two lictors only, showing his state of mind\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby his outward appearance. Octavius understood and imitated his example,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshowing his intended good-will toward Lucius. When he saw the latter\n\t\t\t\t\t\thastening to pass inside his fortification, indicating thereby that he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready surrendered, Octavius anticipated him and went outside the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfortification in order that Lucius might still be free to consult and decide\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconcerning his own interests. Thus as they moved forward they foreshadowed\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir intentions to each other in advance, by their retinue and their\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutward appearance.", "When they came to the ditch they saluted each other, and Lucius said: \"If I\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere a foreigner waging war against you, Octavius, I should consider it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisgraceful to be vanquished in this way and still more disgraceful to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurrender, and I should have for myself an easy means of deliverance from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch humiliation. Since I have been contending with a countryman, my equal\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin rank, in a matter appertaining to our common country, I do not consider\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit disgraceful to be beaten in such a cause by such a man. This I say not to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeprecate any suffering that you may choose to inflict upon me (for you see\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat I have come to your camp without any guarantee), but to ask for others\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch pardon as may be just, and conducive to your own interests. That I may\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmake this clear to you it is necessary to separate their cause from mine, so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat, when you know that I am the only one to blame, you may visit your\n\t\t\t\t\t\twrath upon me, and not think that I have come here to bandy words (that\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould be inopportune), but to tell the truth, for it is not in my power to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspeak otherwise.", "\"I undertook this war against you, not in order to succeed to the leadership\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby destroying you, but to restore to the country the patrician government\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had been subverted by the triumvirate, as not even yourself will deny.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor when you created the triumvirate you acknowledged that it was not in\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccordance with law, but you established it as something necessary and\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttemporary because Cassius and Brutus were still alive and you could not be\n\t\t\t\t\t\treconciled to them. When they, who had been the head of the faction, were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdead, and the remainder, if there were any left, were bearing arms, not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the state, but because they feared you, and moreover the five years'\n\t\t\t\t\t\tterm was running out, I demanded that the magistracies should be revived in\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccordance with the customs of our fathers, not even preferring my brother\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto my country, but hoping to persuade him to assent upon his return and\n\t\t\t\t\t\thastening to bring this about during my own term of office. If you had begun\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis reform you alone would have reaped the glory. Since I was not able to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersuade you, I thought to march against the city and to use force, being a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcitizen, a nobleman, and a consul. These are the causes of the war I waged\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand these alone; not my brother, nor Manius, nor Fulvia, nor the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolonization of those who fought at Philippi, nor pity for the cultivators\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho were deprived of their holdings, since I myself appointed the leaders of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcolonies to my brother's legions who deprived the cultivators of their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossessions and divided them among the soldiers. Yet you brought this charge\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst me before the soldiers, shifting the cause of the war from yourself\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the land distribution, and in this way chiefly you drew them to your side\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand overcame me, for they were persuaded that I was warring against them,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand that they were defending themselves against my wrong-doing. You\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcertainly needed to use artifice in the war you were waging. Now that you\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave conquered, if you are the enemy of the country you must consider me\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour enemy also, since I wished what I thought was for her advantage, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas prevented by famine from accomplishing it.", "\"While I say these things I surrender myself to you, as I have already\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeclared, to do with me whatever you wish. I came here alone merely to show\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhat I have thought of you heretofore and what I still think. So much for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmyself. Concerning my friends and my whole army, if you will not discredit\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmy words, I will give you some advice for your own best interests, and that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis, that you inflict no severity upon them on account of the quarrel between\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou and me.

After they had received the watchword they still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkept their outposts on duty, for Octavius himself ordered that each army\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould keep its own guard that night. The next morning Octavius offered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsacrifice, and Lucius sent his soldiers to him bearing their arms, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprepared for marching. They saluted Octavius as imperator while still at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome distance, and each legion took its separate position as Octavius had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdirected, the colonized veterans being apart from the new levies. When\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius had finished the sacrifice he took his seat in front of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttribunal, crowned with laurel, the symbol of victory, and ordered them all\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto lay down their arms where they stood. When they had done so he ordered\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe veterans to draw nearer, intending to reproach them for their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tingratitude and to strike terror into them. It was known beforehand what he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas about to do, and his own army, either purposely (as soldiers are often\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvised beforehand), or moved by sympathy as for their own relatives, broke\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the formation in which they had been placed, crowded around Lucius' men\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas they approached their former fellow-soldiers, embraced them, wept with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthem, and implored Octavius in their behalf, and ceased not crying out and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tembracing them, the new levies sharing in the outburst of feeling, so that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit was impossible to distinguish or discriminate between them.", "For this reason Octavius did not persist in his intention, but, after\n\t\t\t\t\t\tappeasing the tumult with difficulty, addressed his own men as follows: \"You\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave always behaved in such a way to me, fellow-soldiers, that you can ask\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnothing from me in vain. I think that the new levies served Lucius under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompulsion. I intended to ask the old soldiers, who have often served with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tus and who are now saved from punishment by you, what they have suffered at\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour hands, or what favor they have asked in vain, or what greater favors\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey expected from anybody else, that they have taken up arms against me,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst you, against them-selves.

And now if\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou will permit me I will ask them these questions.\" They would not allow\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim to do so, but continued their beseeching. \"I grant what you wish,\" he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid. \"They are dismissed without punishment for their wrongdoing, provided\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey will hereafter be like-minded with you.\" They promised on both sides\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith acclamations and thanks to Octavius, who allowed some of his own men to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tentertain some of their men as guests. He ordered the remainder to pitch\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir tents where they had been stationed, at a certain distance from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers, until he should assign them towns for winter quarters and appoint\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpersons to lead them thither.", "Then, seated on his tribunal, Octavius summoned from Perusia Lucius and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans of responsibility who were with him. Many of the senators and knights\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcame down, all presenting a pitiful appearance by reason of their sudden\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchange of fortune.

A strong wind fanned the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconflagration and drove it over the whole of Perusia, which was entirely\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsumed, except the temple of Vulcan. Such was the end of Perusia, a city\n\t\t\t\t\t\trenowned for its antiquity and importance.

Pompeius yielded and set sail for naria with a large\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of his best ships, having embarked himself on a magnificent one with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsix banks of oars. In this style, toward evening, he sailed proudly past\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPuteoli in sight of his enemies.

Their ships were moored\n\t\t\t\t\t\talongside and guards were stationed around them, and the banqueters were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgirded with concealed daggers. It is said that, while the three were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfeasting in the ship, Menodorus sent a message to Pompeius advising him to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tentrap these men and avenge the wrongs of his father and his brother, and to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tavail himself of this most favorable occasion to resume the sway that his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfather had exercised, saying that he, with his own ships, would take care\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat nobody should escape; but that Pompeius replied, in a manner worthy of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this family and his position, \"Would that Menodorus had done this without my\n\t\t\t\t\t\tknowledge.

This was considered an omen\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof what was to take place. As the belief still prevailed that this war was a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tviolation of the treaty, Octavius sought to dispel the suspicion. He wrote\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the city and he told his soldiers that Pompeius had violated the treaty\n\t\t\t\t\t\tby encouraging piracy, that the pirates had confessed this, that Menodorus\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad revealed the whole design, and that Antony knew it, and for that reason\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad refused to give up the Peloponnesus.", "When all things were in readiness he set sail for Sicily, going himself from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTarentum, while Calvisius, with Sabinus and Menodorus, sailed from Etruria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe infantry was sent on the march to Rhegium and great haste was displayed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin all quarters.

While the hostile fleets were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadvancing from both sides, he awaited the attack of Octavius at Messana, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tordered his freedman Menecrates, who was the bitterest enemy of Menodorus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto advance against Calvisius and Menodorus with a large fleet. Menecrates\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas observed by his enemies near nightfall on the open sea. They retired\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinto the bay near Cum, where they passed the night, Menecrates\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproceeding to naria. At daybreak they drew up their fleet, in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tform of a crescent, as close to the shore as possible, in order to prevent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe enemy from breaking through it. Menecrates again showed himself, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\timmediately came on with a rush. As his enemies would not advance to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\topen sea, and he could do nothing of importance there, he made a charge in\n\t\t\t\t\t\torder to drive them upon the land. They beached their ships and fought back\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst the attacking prows. Menecrates had the opportunity to draw off and\n\t\t\t\t\t\trenew the attack as he pleased, and to bring up fresh ships by turns, while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe enemy were distressed by the rocks, on which they had grounded, and by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe inability to move. They were like infantry contending against sea\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforces, unable either to pursue or retreat.", "In this situation Menodorus and Menecrates came in sight of each other; and,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabandoning the rest of the fight, drove against each other with fury and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshouting, as though they had staked the issue of the battle on this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencounter, whichever should be the victor. Their ships came into violent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcollision and were badly damaged, Menodorus losing his prow and Menecrates\n\t\t\t\t\t\this oar-blades. Grapplingirons were thrown by both, and the ships, being\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfastened together, could no longer manuvre, but the men, as in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattle on land, failed not in deeds of valor.

The day of Octavius'\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsailing had been previously communicated to all. It was the tenth day after\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe summer solstice. This, in the Roman calendar, was the calends of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmonth which, in honor of the first Csar, they call July instead\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Quintilis. Octavius fixed on this day, perhaps because he considered it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpropitious on account of his father, who was always victorious. Pompeius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstationed Plennius at Lilybum with one legion and a considerable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbody of light-armed troops, to oppose Lepidus. He guarded the whole coast of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSicily, both east and west, and especially the islands of Lipara and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCossyra, lest they should become convenient harbors and naval stations for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius and Lepidus against Sicily. The best part of his naval force he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkept together at Messana watching its chances.

Octavius sailed from Puteoli,\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffering sacrifices and pouring out libations from the admiral's ship into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe water to the propitious winds, and to Neptune, the guardian, and to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttranquil sea, that they should be his assistants against his father's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies. Certain ships sent in advance made examination of the bays, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAppius with a large squadron followed as a rear guard. On the third day\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter their departure a south wind blew with violence and capsized a large\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnumber of ships of burden belonging to Lepidus. Nevertheless, he reached the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSicilian coast, laid siege to Plennius in Lilybum, and got\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpossession of some towns by persuasion and others by force. When the wind\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbegan to blow Taurus returned to Tarentum. While Appius was doubling the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpromontory of Minerva, some of his ships were shattered against the rocks,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers ran with violence on the shoals, and the rest were dispersed, not\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout injury. At the beginning of the storm, Octavius took refuge in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsheltered bay of Elea, except one six-banked ship, which was wrecked on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpromontory. The south wind was succeeded by a southwester, which threw the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbay into commotion, as it opened toward the west. It was impossible to sail\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout of the bay with the wind still ahead, nor could the ships be held by\n\t\t\t\t\t\toars or anchors. They crashed against each other or against the rocks, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe confusion became worse confounded by night.", "When the tempest had subsided, Octavius buried the dead, cared for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twounded, clothed those who had swum ashore and furnished them with new\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweapons, and repaired his whole fleet with the means at his command. Six of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this heavy ships, twenty-six lighter ones, and a still larger number of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tliburnicas had been destroyed.

In anticipation of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore serious misfortune he sent Mcenas to Rome on account of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthose who were still under the spell of the memory of Pompey the Great, for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fame of that man had not yet lost its influence over them. Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself visited the new colonies throughout Italy and dispelled their fears,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich had been excited by the recent events. He also went to Tarentum and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinspected the naval force under Taurus. Thence he proceeded to Vibo, where\n\t\t\t\t\t\the encouraged his infantry and hastened the preparations of his fleet, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttime for his second invasion of Sicily being near at hand.", "Pompeius did not deign to seize the fine opportunity presented to him by so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmany shipwrecks. He merely offered sacrifice to the sea and to Neptune,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassuming to call himself their son, and persuading himself that it was not\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithout the special act of Providence that his enemies had been twice\n\t\t\t\t\t\toverwhelmed in this way in the summer months.

Then he placed himself with his heavy ships in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcentre, and summoned the remainder of his fleet from Hiera in all haste. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreparations on both sides were superb. The ships had towers on both stem\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand stern.

The others broke through the deck and escaped by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tswimming. Papias escaped to a ship alongside of his own, and returned to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbattle.

They could not distinguish anything, however\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsharply they might look, but merely a long-drawn-out line of 600 ships, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan alternation of cries and groans now on one side and now on the other.", "Judging from the colors of the towers, which constituted the only difference\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween them, Agrippa with difficulty made out that Pompeius' ships had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsustained the greater loss, and he cheered on those who were close to him as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthough they were already victors. Then he drove at the enemy and pressed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tupon them without ceasing, until he overpowered those nearest him. They then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlowered their towers and turned their ships in flight toward the straits.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSeventeen of them, which were in advance, made their escape thither. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\trest were cut off by Agrippa and some were pursued and driven aground. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpursuers ran aground with them in the rush, and either pulled off those that\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad come to a standstill or set fire to them. When the Pompeian ships that\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere still fighting saw what had befallen these, they surrendered to their\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies. Then the soldiers of Octavius who were in the ships raised a shout\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof victory and those on the land gave an answering shout. Those of Pompeius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgroaned. Pompeius himself, darting away from Naulochi, hastened to Messana,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgiving no orders to his infantry in his panic. Accordingly Octavius received\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe surrender of Tisienus on terms agreed upon, and of the cavalry besides,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho were surrendered by their officers. Three of Octavius' ships were sunk\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the fight. Pompeius lost twenty-eight in this way, and the remainder were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tburned, or captured, or run aground, and stove in pieces, except the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tseventeen that escaped.", "Pompeius learned of the defection of his infantry while on the road, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanged his costume from that of a commander to that of a private citizen,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand sent orders to Messana to put on shipboard everything possible. All\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreparations to this end had been made long before. He summoned Plennius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Lilybum in haste, with the eight legions he had, intending\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto take flight with them. Plennius hastened to comply with this order, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas other friends, garrisons, and soldiers were deserting, and the enemy's\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfleet was moving into the straits, Pompeius did not wait for Plennius in his\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell-fortified city, but fled, with his seventeen ships, from Messana to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony, whose mother he had saved in similar circumstances. After his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeparture Plennius arrived at Messana and occupied the place. Octavius\n\t\t\t\t\t\thimself remained in the camp at Naulochi, but he ordered Agrippa to lay\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsiege to Messana, which the latter did, in conjunction with Lepidus.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPlennius sent envoys to treat for peace. Agrippa wanted to wait till morning\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the arrival of Octavius, but Lepidus granted terms, and, in order to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconciliate the soldiers of Plennius to himself, allowed them to join the\n\t\t\t\t\t\trest of the army in plundering the city. They had asked for nothing but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsafety, and now, finding unexpected gain in addition, they plundered Messana\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe whole night, in conjunction with the soldiers of Lepidus, and then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tranged themselves under his standards."]}, {"@type": "chapter", "@n": "13", "@id": "b5c13", "head": "CHAPTER XIII", "argument": {"p": "Lepidus lays Claim to Sicily -- Octavius tampers with his Troops --\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConflict in the Camp of Lepidus -- He is deserted by his Soldiers --\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLepidus deposed from his Command -- Octavius does not pursue Pompeius --\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMutiny in the Army -- It is suppressed by Octavius -- Octavius rewards\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\this Soldiers and returns to Italy -- Unbounded Honors bestowed upon him\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat Rome -- He refuses to punish Lepidus -- Robbery suppressed --\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctavius elected Tribune for Life"}, "milestone": [{"@n": "123", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "124", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "125", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "126", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "127", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "128", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "129", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "130", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "131", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "132", "@unit": "section"}], "p": ["Including this new accession, Lepidus now had twenty-two legions of infantry\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand a large body of cavalry.

He landed at Mitylene and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspent some time at that place, where his father, when at war with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCsar, had bestowed him with his mother, when he was still a boy,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand where his father had recovered him after his defeat. As Antony was now\n\t\t\t\t\t\twaging war in Media against the Medes and the Parthians, Pompeius decided to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintrust himself to Antony on his return. When he heard that Antony had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tworsted, and this result was confirmed by the reports, his hopes once more\n\t\t\t\t\t\trevived, and he fancied that he might succeed Antony if the latter were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdead, or share his power if he returned. He was continually thinking of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLabienus, who had overrun Asia not long before. While he was in this frame\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof mind the news reached him that Antony had returned to Alexandria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tScheming with both projects, he sent ambassadors to Antony ostensibly to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplace himself at the latter's disposal and to offer himself as a friend and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tally, but really to get accurate information about Antony's affairs. At the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame time he sent others secretly to the princes of Thrace and Pontus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintending, if he should not obtain what he desired from Antony, to take\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflight through Pontus to Armenia. He sent also to the Parthians, hoping\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat, for the remainder of their war against Antony, they would be eager to\n\t\t\t\t\t\treceive him as a general, because he was a Roman, and especially because he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas the son of Pompey the Great. He refitted his ships and drilled the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers he had brought in them, pretending at one time that he was in fear\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Octavius, and at another that he was getting ready to assist Antony.", "As soon as Antony heard of the coming of Pompeius he designated Titius to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake the field against him. He ordered the latter to take ships and soldiers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Syria and to wage war vigorously against Pompeius if he showed himself\n\t\t\t\t\t\thostile, but to treat him with honor if he submitted himself to Antony. Then\n\t\t\t\t\t\the gave audience to the ambassadors who had arrived, and who addressed him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tas follows: \"Pompeius has sent us to you, not because he was without a place\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof refuge (if he were minded to continue the war) in Spain, a country\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfriendly to him on his father's account and which espoused his own cause\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhen he was younger, and even now calls upon him for that purpose, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he prefers to enjoy peace with you, or, if need be, to fight under\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour orders. He makes these advances now not for the first time, but did so\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile he was master of Sicily and was ravaging Italy, and when he rescued\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour mother and sent her to you. If you had accepted these advances,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius would not have been driven out of Sicily (for you would not have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovided Octavius with ships against him), nor would you have been defeated\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin Parthia, in consequence of Octavius, not sending you the soldiers he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagreed to send. In fact, you would now be in possession of Italy in addition\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto your other dominions. As you did not accept the offer at the time when it\n\t\t\t\t\t\twould have been most advantageous to you, he repeats it now in order that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou may not be so often ensnared by Octavius' words and by the marriage\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelationship existing between you; for you will remember that, although he\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis connected by marriage with Pompeius, he declared war against the latter\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter the treaty had been made, and without excuse. He also deprived\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLepidus, his partner in the government, of his share, and divided no part of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit with you.", "\"You are now the only remaining one who stands between him and the monarchy\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat he longs for. He would already have been at blows with you, had not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPompeius stood in the way. Although you ought to have foreseen these things\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor yourself, Pompeius calls your attention to them out of good-will,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he prefers a candid and magnanimous man to a deceitful, treacherous,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand artful one. He does not blame you for the gift of ships which you made\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto Octavius against him as a matter of necessity, in order to procure\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers for the Parthian war in exchange, but he reminds you that those\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers were not sent. In short, Pompeius delivers himself to you with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tships which he still has and his most faithful soldiers, who have not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabandoned him even in his flight. If peace is maintained, it will be a great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tglory to you to have saved the son of Pompey the Great.

Seeing Pompeius drilling his troops, he  mustered\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta force from the provincials and hastily summoned Ahenobarbus, who had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommand of an army in the vicinity, and also Amyntas from the other side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey responded promptly, and Pompeius complained against Furnius for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tregarding him in the light of an enemy when he had sent ambassadors to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony and was waiting for an answer from him. While he was saying this he\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas meditating the project of seizing Ahenobarbus, with the connivance of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCurius, one of Ahenobarbus' officers, intending to hold that general as a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvaluable hostage to exchange for himself in case of need. The treachery was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscovered and Curius was convicted before the Romans present and put to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeath. Pompeius put to death his freedman Theodorus, the only person who was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprivy to the plan, believing that he had divulged it. As he no longer\n\t\t\t\t\t\texpected to conceal his projects from Furnius, he possessed himself of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLampsacus by treachery, a city which contained many Italians, colonized\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere by Gaius Csar. These Italians he induced to enter his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmilitary service by large bounties. Having now 200 horse and three legions\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof infantry, he attacked Cyzicus by land and sea. He was repulsed on both\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsides, because there was a force, although not a large one, in Cyzicus, that\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas guarding some gladiators whom Antony supported there.

As Pompeius had no cavalry, he assaulted the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcamp of Furnius in front and, at the same time, sent a force secretly around\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto his rear. Furnius accordingly directed his forces against Pompeius' front\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattack, but he was driven out of his camp by the force in his rear. Pompeius\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpursued his men and killed many as they fled over the Scamandrian plain,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was saturated with recent rains. Those who were saved withdrew to a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplace of safety, as they were not fit for battle. While they were waiting\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor assistance from Mysia, the Propontis, and elsewhere, the inhabitants,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho were distressed by continual exactions, enlisted gladly under Pompeius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tespecially on account of the reputation he had gained by his victory at the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tharbor of the Achans. While Pompeius was deficient in cavalry,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand was thus crippled in procuring supplies, he learned that a troop of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tItalian horse was coming to Antony, sent by Octavia, who was passing the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twinter in Athens. So he sent emissaries with gold to corrupt this troop, but\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony's governor of Macedonia caught these men and distributed their gold\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the cavalry.", "Pompeius took Nica and Nicomedia, from which he obtained large\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupplies of money, and his strength was augmented in all respects with a\n\t\t\t\t\t\trapidity that exceeded his expectations. But Furnius, who was camping not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfar away from him, was renforced, at the beginning of spring,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst with seventy ships that had come from Sicily, which had been saved\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom those that Antony had lent to Octavius against Pompeius; for after the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclose of the war in Sicily Octavius had dismissed them. Then Titius arrived\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom Syria with 120 additional ships and a large army; and all these had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlanded at Proconnesus. Pompeius became alarmed and burned his own ships and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmed his oarsmen, believing that he could fight to better advantage with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall of his forces combined on land. Cassius of Parma, Nasidius, Saturninus,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThermus, Antistius, and the other distinguished men of his party who were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstill with him as friends, and Fannius, who held the highest rank of all,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand Pompeius' father-in-law, Libo, when they saw that he did not desist from\n\t\t\t\t\t\twar against superior forces even after Titius, to whom Antony had given\n\t\t\t\t\t\tentire charge, had arrived, despaired of him, and, having made terms for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthemselves, went over to Antony.", "Pompeius, now deserted by his friends, withdrew to the interior of Bithynia,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing reported as making his way to Armenia. One night as he marched out of\n\t\t\t\t\t\this camp quietly, Furnius and Titius followed him, and Amyntas joined in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpursuit. After a hot chase they came up with him toward evening, and each\n\t\t\t\t\t\tencamped by himself around a certain hill without ditch or palisade, as it\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas late and they were tired. While they were in this state, Pompeius made a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnight attack with 300 light troops and killed many who were still asleep or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspringing out of bed. The rest took to disgraceful flight in a state of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnudity. It is evident that if Pompeius had made this night attack with his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tentire army, or if he had followed up energetically the victory he did win,\n\t\t\t\t\t\the would have overcome them completely. But, misled by a god, he gave no\n\t\t\t\t\t\theed to these opportunities, and he gained no other advantage from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\taffair than to penetrate farther into the interior of the country. His\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies, having formed a junction, followed him and cut off his supplies,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuntil he was in danger from want. Then he sought an interview with Furnius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twho had been a friend of Pompey the Great, and who was of higher rank and of\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta more trustworthy character than the others.", "Taking a position where a river flowed between them, Pompeius said that he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad sent ambassadors to Antony, and he added that, being in need of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprovisions meanwhile, and nobody supplying him, he had done what he had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdone. \"If you have fought against me,\" he continued, \"by Antony's direction,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAntony has misconceived his own interests in not foreseeing the coming war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you are anticipating Antony's intentions, I protest and implore you to\n\t\t\t\t\t\twait for the embassy that I sent to Antony or to take and bring me to him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnow. I will surrender myself to you alone, Furnius, asking merely your\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpledge that you will conduct me to him in safety.\" He spoke thus because he\n\t\t\t\t\t\thad confidence in Antony as a man of generous nature, and he apprehended\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmerely that something might happen to him on the journey. Furnius replied to\n\t\t\t\t\t\thim as follows: \"If you wished to surrender yourself to Antony you ought to\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave done so in the beginning, or else have waited quietly at Mitylene for\n\t\t\t\t\t\this answer. But if you desired the war you should have done as you have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdone. Why is it necessary to recount your deeds to one who knows them?

Besides being angry he considered it beneath his dignity to be in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe power of Titius, who was not of noble birth. Moreover he suspected\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTitius, either because he was acquainted with his character and did not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsider him trustworthy, or because he was conscious of some old injury\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdone to him previous to the benefaction above mentioned. Again he offered to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurrender himself to Furnius, and begged that he would receive him. When the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlatter refused he said that he would surrender to Amyntas. Furnius said that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAmyntas would not receive him, because that would be an insult to the one\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhom Antony had intrusted with this whole business; and so the interview\n\t\t\t\t\t\tended. The opinion prevailed in the camp of Furnius that, for want of other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresources, Pompeius would deliver himself up to Titius on the following day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen night came Pompeius left the customary fires burning, and the trumpets\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgiving the usual signal at intervals through the night, while he quietly\n\t\t\t\t\t\twithdrew from the camp with a well-prepared band, who had not been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpreviously advised whither they were to go. He intended to go to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsea-shore and burn Titius' fleet, and perhaps would have done so had not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tScaurus deserted from him and communicated the fact of his departure and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\troad he had taken, although ignorant of his design. Amyntas, with  horse, pursued Pompeius, who had no cavalry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen Amyntas drew near, Pompeius' men passed over to him, some privately,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tothers openly.

After their death he concealed himself for\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta long time and practised robbery secretly in Spain until he had collected a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge following, because he made himself known as Pompey's son.

Of most importance was the aid that he rendered to the proscribed in\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRome exposed to utter destruction, rescuing many of the nobility who were,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat this later time, safe at home by means of him.

Others say that it was not that pious sight that saved him, but that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneas had often urged the barbarians to give Helen back to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAchans. There, having collected a band of Phrygians, he departed to Laurentum, and having\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarried Lavinia, the daughter of Latinus, king of the Aborigines, he built a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcity and named it Lavinium after his wife. Three years later Latinus died,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand neas succeeded to the kingdom, by virtue of his marriage\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelationship, and gave the name of Latins to the Aborigines. Three years\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlater still, Mezentius, the king of the Rutuli, engaged in war with him\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause Lavinia had been previously betrothed to himself, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneas was slain."}, "Ascanius then became king in his stead. Despising Lavinium as a paltry town,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAscanius founded another under the Alban mount and named it Alba, which,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tafter it had held sway 300 years, the Romans destroyed, so that not even a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfoundation was left. Silvius, the third in descent, succeeded Ascanius. Then\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanother neas was the fourth, Latinus was the fifth, Capys the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsixth, Capetus the seventh, Tiberinus the eighth, Agrippa the ninth, Romulus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe tenth, Aventinus the eleventh, Procas the twelfth, and Numitor and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAmulius the thirteenth.", "The father of these left the kingdom to Numitor as the elder of the two. His\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrother Amulius dispossessed him and became king. Amulius, fearing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvengeance, slew Egestus, Numitor's son, while hunting, and being\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapprehensive lest the sister of Egestus should bear children he made her a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvestal. She became pregnant, as she said, by Mars, while drawing water from\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta fountain sacred to him, and gave birth to Remus and Romulus. Amulius\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccordingly incarcerated her and gave the boys to be thrown into the Tiber,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich was at that time called the Thubris. The bearers took the boys to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\triver. They were shepherds, and they placed the basket on the margin of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\twater where the river was marshy. After they had gone away the water receded\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the babes were left on dry land, and a she-wolf stepped into the basket\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand suckled them.

But Numitor, when he beheld the young\n\t\t\t\t\t\tman and reckoned up the time when he was exposed and the other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcircumstances, began to suspect the truth, and examined him closely as to\n\t\t\t\t\t\this bringing up. Romulus became alarmed, and learning from Faustulus the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfacts concerning himself and his brother, and how his mother had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincarcerated, collected a band of shepherds and with them attacked Amulius,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand, having killed him, proclaimed Numitor king of the Albans. Then they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbuilt a city on the bank of the river by the side of which they had been\n\t\t\t\t\t\texposed and nourished, and where they had practised robbery after they had\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrown up; and they named it Rome.
